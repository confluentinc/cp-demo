Troubleshooting the Scripted |cp| Demo
======================================

If the start script does not complete successfully, please go through the following troubleshooting steps.

======
Docker
======

#. Upon startup, if the output is similar to below, it is possible that the environment is not supported or ``cp-demo`` was not started properly. Please read the pre-requisites and follow proper instructions at :ref:`Module 1 <cp-demo-on-prem-tutorial>`.

   .. code-block:: bash

      WARNING: The REPOSITORY variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
      WARNING: The SSL_CIPHER_SUITES variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
      WARNING: The CONNECTOR_VERSION variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
      WARNING: The CONTROL_CENTER_KSQL_WIKIPEDIA_URL variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
      WARNING: The CONTROL_CENTER_KSQL_WIKIPEDIA_ADVERTISED_URL variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.

#. Verify that the status of all the Docker containers show ``Up`` state.

   .. code-block:: bash

      docker-compose ps

#. In the advanced Docker preferences settings, verify the following resources are allocated to Docker:

   - Memory: at least 8 GB (default is 2 GB)
   - CPU cores: at least 2 cores

#. Verify you have not run out of disk storage needed for Docker's "disk image" file (`Docker documentation <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/space/>`__).


====
Logs
====

#. If the script errors out before completing, or if there are Docker containers that are not in ``Up`` state, view the container's logs with the command ``docker-compose logs [container]`` and look for error messages and exceptions.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      docker-compose logs

#. If there are any errors that indicate issues with TLS communication, verify that the TLS certificates were properly generated and that there are no errors in the following files:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ls scripts/security/*.log

========
Security
========

#. If there are any errors that indicate issues with TLS communication, force TLS certificates to be regenerated by starting the script with ``CLEAN=true``:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      CLEAN=true ./scripts/start.sh

#. If a command that communicates with |zk| appears to be failing with the error ``org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException$NoAuthException``,
   change the container you are running the command from to be either ``kafka1`` or ``kafka2``.  This is because |zk| is configured for
   :ref:`SASL/DIGEST-MD5 <sasl_plain_zk>`, and
   any commands that communicate with |zk| need properties set for |zk| authentication.

========
Validate
========

#. Verify there are messages in the |ak|  topics, including ``wikipedia.parsed``:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      ./scripts/consumers/listen.sh

#. Run the :devx-cp-demo:`validation scripts|scripts/validate/` to verify that they pass.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      cd scripts/validate/

=========
CLI Login
=========

#. If you are running ``cp-demo`` for a long time and issuing Confluent CLI commands on the ``tools`` container that error out with:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          Your token has expired. You are now logged out.
          Error: You must log in to run that command.

   Then run the following command, which refreshes the token by logging back in to MDS:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          ./scripts/helper/refresh_mds_login.sh
