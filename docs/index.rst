Kafka Event Streaming Application
=================================

This demo shows users how to deploy a Kafka event streaming application using `KSQL <https://www.confluent.io/product/ksql/>`__ and `Kafka Streams <https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/index.html>`__ for stream processing. All the components in the Confluent platform have security enabled end-to-end.


========
Overview
========

The use case is a Kafka event streaming application for real-time edits to real Wikipedia
pages. Wikimedia Foundation has IRC channels that publish edits
happening to real wiki pages (e.g. ``#en.wikipedia``, ``#en.wiktionary``) in
real time. Using `Kafka
Connect <http://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/index.html>`__, a
Kafka source connector
`kafka-connect-irc <https://github.com/cjmatta/kafka-connect-irc>`__
streams raw messages from these IRC channels, and a custom Kafka Connect
transform
`kafka-connect-transform-wikiedit <https://github.com/cjmatta/kafka-connect-transform-wikiedit>`__
transforms these messages and then the messages are written to a Kafka
cluster. This demo uses `KSQL <https://www.confluent.io/product/ksql/>`__
and `Kafka Streams <http://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/index.html>`__
for data processing. Then a Kafka sink connector
`kafka-connect-elasticsearch <http://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/connect-elasticsearch/docs/elasticsearch_connector.html>`__
streams the data out of Kafka, applying another custom Kafka Connect
transform called NullFilter. The data is materialized into
`Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch>`__ for
analysis by `Kibana <https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana>`__.
Use `Confluent Control Center <https://www.confluent.io/product/control-center/>`__ for management and monitoring.

.. note:: This is a Docker environment and has all services running on one host. Do not use this demo in production. It is meant exclusively to easily demo the |CP|. In production, |c3| should be deployed with a valid license and with its own dedicated metrics cluster, separate from the cluster with production traffic. Using a dedicated metrics cluster is more resilient because it continues to provide system health monitoring even if the production traffic cluster experiences issues.

You can also view and edit settings of Kafka topics in the cluster. Read more on |c3| `topic management <https://docs.confluent.io/current/control-center/docs/topics.html>`__.

   .. figure:: images/create_topic.png
         :alt: image

#.  Dataflow: you can derive which producers are writing to which topics and which consumers are reading from which topics.
    When Confluent Monitoring Interceptors are configured on Kafka clients, they write metadata to a topic named ``_confluent-monitoring``.
    Kafka clients include any application that uses the Apache Kafka client API to connect to Kafka brokers, such as
    custom client code or any service that has embedded producers or consumers, such as Kafka Connect, KSQL, or a Kafka Streams application.
    |c3| uses that topic to ensure that all messages are delivered and to provide statistics on throughput and latency
    performance. From that same topic, you can also derive which producers are writing to which topics and which consumers
    are reading from which topics, and an example script is provided with the repo (note: this is for demo purposes
    only, not suitable for production). The command is:

    .. sourcecode:: bash

      ./scripts/app/map_topics_clients.py

    Your output should resemble:

    .. sourcecode:: bash

Connect
-------

1. |c3| uses the Kafka Connect API to manage multiple `connect clusters <https://docs.confluent.io/current/control-center/docs/connect.html>`__.  Click on "Connect".

2. Select ``connect-default``, the name of the cluster of |kconnect| workers.

   .. figure:: images/connect_default.png

3. Verify the connectors running in this demo:

   - source connector ``wikipedia-irc``
   - source connector ``replicate-topic``
   - sink connector ``elasticsearch-ksql`` consuming from the Kafka topic ``WIKIPEDIABOT``

   .. figure:: images/connector_list.png

4. Click any connector name to view or modify any details of the connector configuration and custom transforms.

   .. figure:: images/connect_replicator_settings.png


.. _ksql-demo-3:

KSQL
----

In this demo, KSQL is authenticated and authorized to connect to the secured Kafka cluster, and it is already running queries as defined in the `KSQL command file <https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-demo/blob/master/scripts/ksql/ksqlcommands>`__.

1. In the navigation bar, click **KSQL**.

2. From the list of KSQL applications, select ``KSQL``.

   .. figure:: images/ksql_link.png
      :alt: image

3. Alternatively, run KSQL CLI to get to the KSQL CLI prompt.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

        docker-compose exec ksql-cli ksql http://ksql-server:8088

4. View the existing KSQL streams. (If you are using the KSQL CLI, at the ``ksql>`` prompt type ``SHOW STREAMS;``).

   .. figure:: images/ksql_streams_list.png
      :alt: image

5. Describe the schema (fields or columns) and source and sink of an existing KSQL stream. Click on ``WIKIPEDIA``.

   .. figure:: images/wikipedia_describe.png
      :alt: image

6. View the existing KSQL tables. (If you are using the KSQL CLI, at the ``ksql>`` prompt type ``SHOW TABLES;``).

   .. figure:: images/ksql_tables_list.png
      :alt: image

7. View the existing KSQL queries, which are continuously running. (If you are using the KSQL CLI, at the ``ksql>`` prompt type ``SHOW QUERIES;``).

   .. figure:: images/ksql_queries_list.png
      :alt: image

8. View messages from different KSQL streams and tables. Click on your stream of choice and select **Query** to open the Query Editor. The editor shows a pre-populated query, like ``select * from WIKIPEDIA;``, and it shows results for newly arriving data.

   .. figure:: images/ksql_query_topic.png
      :alt: image

9. Click **KSQL Editor** and run the ``SHOW PROPERTIES;`` statement. You can see the configured KSQL server properties and check these values with the `docker-compose.yml` file.

   .. figure:: images/ksql_properties.png
      :alt: image

10. This demo creates two streams ``EN_WIKIPEDIA_GT_1`` and ``EN_WIKIPEDIA_GT_1_COUNTS``, and the reason is to demonstrate how KSQL windows work. ``EN_WIKIPEDIA_GT_1`` counts occurences with a tumbling window, and for a given key it writes a `null` into the table on the first seen message.  The underlying Kafka topic for ``EN_WIKIPEDIA_GT_1`` does not filter out those nulls, but since we want to send downstream just the counts greater than one, there is a separate Kafka topic for ````EN_WIKIPEDIA_GT_1_COUNTS`` which does filter out those nulls (e.g., the query has a clause ``where ROWTIME is not null``).  From the bash prompt, view those underlying Kafka topics.

View messages in ``EN_WIKIPEDIA_GT_1``:

.. sourcecode:: bash

      docker exec connect kafka-avro-console-consumer --bootstrap-server kafka1:9091 --topic EN_WIKIPEDIA_GT_1 \
        --property schema.registry.url=https://schemaregistry:8085 \

      ...


Consumers
---------

1. |c3| enables you to monitor consumer lag and throughput performance. Consumer lag is the topic's high water mark (latest offset for the topic that has been written) minus the current consumer offset (latest offset read for that topic by that consumer group). Keep in mind the topic's write rate and consumer group's read rate when you consider the significance the consumer lag's size. Click on "Consumers".

2. Consumer lag is available on a `per-consumer basis <https://docs.confluent.io/current/control-center/consumers.html#view-consumer-lag-details-for-a-consumer-group>`__, including embedded consumers in sink connectors (e.g., ``connect-replicator`` and ``connect-elasticsearch-ksql``), KSQL queries (e.g., consumer groups whose names start with ``_confluent-ksql-default_query_``), console consumers (e.g., ``WIKIPEDIANOBOT-consumer``), etc.  Consumer lag is also available on a `per-topic basis <https://docs.confluent.io/current/control-center/topics/view.html#view-consumer-lag-for-a-topic>`__.

   .. figure:: images/consumer_group_list.png
      :alt: image

3. View consumer lag for the persistent KSQL "Create Stream As Select" query ``CSAS_WIKIPEDIABOT``, which is displayed as ``_confluent-ksql-default_query_CSAS_WIKIPEDIABOT_0`` in the consumer group list.

   .. figure:: images/ksql_query_CSAS_WIKIPEDIABOT_consumer_lag.png
      :alt: image

4. View consumer lag for the Kafka Streams application under the consumer group id ``wikipedia-activity-monitor``.

   .. figure:: images/activity-monitor-consumer.png
      :alt: image

5. With `Confluent Monitoring Interceptors <https://docs.confluent.io/current/control-center/installation/clients.html>`__, you may also view additional metrics related to production and consumption of messages, including:

   - Throughput
   - Failed consume requests
   - Percent messages consumed
   - End to end latency

6. View consumption metrics for the persistent KSQL "Create Stream As Select" query ``CSAS_WIKIPEDIABOT``, which is displayed as ``_confluent-ksql-default_query_CSAS_WIKIPEDIABOT_0`` in the consumer group list.

   .. figure:: images/ksql_query_CSAS_WIKIPEDIABOT_consumption.png
      :alt: image


7. |c3| shows which consumers in a consumer group are consuming from which partitions and on which brokers those partitions reside.  |c3| updates as consumer rebalances occur in a consumer group.  Start consuming from topic ``wikipedia.parsed`` with a new consumer group ``app`` with one consumer ``consumer_app_1``. It runs in the background.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          ./scripts/app/start_consumer_app.sh 1

8. Let this consumer group run for 2 minutes until |c3|
   shows the consumer group ``app`` with steady consumption.
   This consumer group ``app`` has a single consumer ``consumer_app_1`` consuming all of the partitions in the topic ``wikipedia.parsed``. 

   .. figure:: images/consumer_start_one.png
      :alt: image

9. Add a second consumer ``consumer_app_2`` to the existing consumer
   group ``app``.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          ./scripts/app/start_consumer_app.sh 2

10. Let this consumer group run for 2 minutes until |c3|
    shows the consumer group ``app`` with steady consumption.
    Notice that the consumers ``consumer_app_1`` and ``consumer_app_2``
    now share consumption of the partitions in the topic
    ``wikipedia.parsed``.

    .. figure:: images/consumer_start_two.png
      :alt: image


11. Click "System health" and then a line in "Request latency".

    .. figure:: images/request_latency_find.png
        :alt: image

12. This shows a breakdown of produce latencies (fetch latencies also available) through the entire `request lifecycle <https://docs.confluent.io/current/control-center/docs/systemhealth.html>`__.

    .. figure:: images/slow_consumer_produce_latency_breakdown.png
        :alt: image


Data Streams: Over Consumption
------------------------------

Streams monitoring in Control Center can highlight consumers that are
over consuming some messages, which is an indication that consumers are
processing a set of messages more than once. This may happen
intentionally, for example an application with a software bug consumed
and processed Kafka messages incorrectly, got a fix, and then
reprocesses previous messages correctly. This may also happen
unintentionally if an application crashes before committing processed
messages. To simulate over consumption, we will use Kafka’s consumer
offset reset tool to set the offset of the consumer group ``app`` to an
earlier offset, thereby forcing the consumer group to reconsume messages
it has previously read.

.. note:: Data Streams view is enabled by setting `confluent.controlcenter.deprecated.views.enable=true`

1. Click on ``Data streams``, and ``View Details`` for the consumer
   group ``app``.

   .. figure:: images/data_streams_app.png
      :alt: image

2. Scroll down to verify there are two consumers ``consumer_app_1`` and
   ``consumer_app_2`` that were created in an earlier section. If these
   two consumers are not running and were never started, start them as
   described in the section `Consumers <#consumers>`__.
   Let this consumer group run for two minutes, until |c3| stream
   monitoring shows the consumer group ``app`` with steady consumption.

   .. figure:: images/verify_two_consumers.png
      :alt: image

3. Stop the consumer group ``app`` to stop consuming from topic
   ``wikipedia.parsed``. Note that the command below stops the consumers
   gracefully with ``kill -15``, so the consumers follow the shutdown
   sequence.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          ./scripts/app/stop_consumer_app_group_graceful.sh

4. Wait for 2 minutes to let messages continue to be written to the
   topics for a while, without being consumed by the consumer group
   ``app``. Notice the red bar which highlights that during the time
   window when the consumer group was stopped, there were some messages
   produced but not consumed. These messages are not missing, they are
   just not consumed because the consumer group stopped.

   .. figure:: images/over_consumption_before_2.png
      :alt: image

5. Reset the offset of the consumer group ``app`` by shifting 200
   offsets backwards. The offset reset tool must be run when the
   consumer is completely stopped. Offset values in output shown below
   will vary.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

         docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-consumer-groups \
           --reset-offsets --group app --shift-by -200 --bootstrap-server kafka1:10091 \
           --all-topics --execute

   Your output should resemble:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

        TOPIC            PARTITION NEW-OFFSET
        wikipedia.parsed 1         4071
        wikipedia.parsed 0         7944

6. Restart consuming from topic ``wikipedia.parsed`` with the consumer
   group ``app`` with two consumers.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          ./scripts/app/start_consumer_app.sh 1
          ./scripts/app/start_consumer_app.sh 2

7. Let this consumer group run for 2 minutes until Control Center stream
   monitoring shows the consumer group ``app`` with steady consumption.
   Notice several things:

   -  Even though the consumer group ``app`` was not running for some of
      this time, all messages are shown as delivered. This is because
      all bars are time windows relative to produce timestamp.
   -  For some time intervals, the the bars are red and consumption line
      is above expected consumption because some messages were consumed
      twice due to rewinding offsets.
   -  The latency peaks and then gradually decreases, because this is
      also relative to the produce timestamp.

   .. figure:: images/over_consumption_after_2.png
      :alt: image


Data Streams: Under Consumption
-------------------------------

Streams monitoring in Control Center can highlight consumers that are
under consuming some messages. This may happen intentionally when
consumers stop and restart and operators change the consumer offsets to
the latest offset. This avoids delay processing messages that were
produced while the consumers were stopped, especially when they care
about real-time. This may also happen unintentionally if a consumer is
offline for longer than the log retention period, or if a producer is
configured for ``acks=0`` and a broker suddenly fails before having a
chance to replicate data to other brokers. To simulate under
consumption, we will use Kafka’s consumer offset reset tool to set the
offset of the consumer group ``app`` to the latest offset, thereby
skipping messages that will never be read.

.. note:: Data Streams view is enabled by setting `confluent.controlcenter.deprecated.views.enable=true`

1. Click on **Data streams**, and **View Details** for the consumer
   group ``app``.

   .. figure:: images/data_streams_app.png
      :alt: image

2. Scroll down to verify there are two consumers ``consumer_app_1`` and
   ``consumer_app_2`` that were created in an earlier section. If these
   two consumers are not running and were never started, start them as
   described in the section `Consumers <#consumers>`__.
   Let this consumer group run for two minutes, until |c3| stream
   monitoring shows the consumer group ``app`` with steady consumption.

   .. figure:: images/verify_two_consumers.png
      :alt: image

3. Stop the consumer group ``app`` to stop consuming from topic
   ``wikipedia.parsed``. Note that the command below stops the consumers
   ungracefully with ``kill -9``, so the consumers did not follow the
   shutdown sequence.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          ./scripts/app/stop_consumer_app_group_ungraceful.sh

4. Wait for 2 minutes to let messages continue to be written to the
   topics for a while, without being consumed by the consumer group
   ``app``. Notice the red bar which highlights that during the time
   window when the consumer group was stopped, there were some messages
   produced but not consumed. These messages are not missing, they are
   just not consumed because the consumer group stopped.

   .. figure:: images/under_consumption_before.png
      :alt: image

5. Reset the offset of the consumer group ``app`` by setting it to
   latest offset. The offset reset tool must be run when the consumer is
   completely stopped. Offset values in output shown below will vary.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

         docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-consumer-groups \
         --reset-offsets --group app --to-latest --bootstrap-server kafka1:10091 \
         --all-topics --execute

   Your output should resemble:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

       TOPIC            PARTITION NEW-OFFSET
       wikipedia.parsed 1         8601
       wikipedia.parsed 0         15135 

6. Restart consuming from topic ``wikipedia.parsed`` with the consumer
   group ``app`` with two consumers.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          ./scripts/app/start_consumer_app.sh 1
          ./scripts/app/start_consumer_app.sh 2

7. Let this consumer group run for two minutes, until |c3| stream
   monitoring shows the consumer group ``app`` with steady consumption.
   Notice that during the time period that the consumer group ``app``
   was not running, no produced messages are shown as delivered.
   The light blue indicates that perhaps the consumer group stopped ungracefully.

   .. figure:: images/under_consumption_after.png
      :alt: image

8. Return to the Data Streams view, find the ``wikipedia-activity-monitor``,
   click on ``View Details`` and then ``Topic partitions``.  From this view
   you can see the consumption status of the various topic and partitions for the
   Kafka Streams Application.

   .. figure:: images/activity-monitor-streams.png
      :alt: image

Failed broker
-------------

To simulate a failed broker, stop the Docker container running one of
the two Kafka brokers.

1. Stop the Docker container running Kafka broker 2.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          docker-compose stop kafka2

2. After a few minutes, observe the Broker summary show that the number of brokers 
   has decreased from 2 to 1, and there are many under replicated
   partitions.

   .. figure:: images/broker_down_failed.png
      :alt: image

3. View Topic information details to see that there are out of sync replicas on broker 2.

   .. figure:: images/broker_down_replicas.png
      :alt: image

4. Restart the Docker container running Kafka broker 2.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          docker-compose start kafka2

5. After about a minute, observe the Broker summary in Confluent
   Control Center. The broker count has recovered to 2, and the topic
   partitions are back to reporting no under replicated partitions.

   .. figure:: images/broker_down_steady.png
      :alt: image

6. Click on the broker count ``2`` inside the "Broker uptime" box to view when
   broker counts changed.

   .. figure:: images/broker_down_times.png
      :alt: image


Alerting
--------

There are many types of Control Center
`alerts <https://docs.confluent.io/current/control-center/docs/alerts.html>`__
and many ways to configure them. Use the Alerts management page to
define triggers and actions, or click on individual resources
to setup alerts from there.

.. figure:: images/c3-alerts-bell-icon-initial.png
   :alt: image


1. This demo already has pre-configured triggers and actions. View the
   Alerts ``Triggers`` screen, and click ``Edit`` against each trigger
   to see configuration details.

   -  The trigger ``Under Replicated Partitions`` happens when a broker
      reports non-zero under replicated partitions, and it causes an
      action ``Email Administrator``.
   -  The trigger ``Consumption Difference`` happens when consumption
      difference for the Elasticsearch connector consumer group is
      greater than ``0``, and it causes an action
      ``Email Administrator``.

   .. figure:: images/alerts_triggers.png
      :alt: image

2. If you followed the steps in the `failed broker <#failed-broker>`__
   section, view the Alert history to see that the trigger
   ``Under Replicated Partitions`` happened and caused an alert when you
   stopped broker 2.


   .. figure:: images/alerts_triggers_under_replication_partitions.png
      :alt: image


3. You can also trigger the ``Consumption Difference`` trigger. In the
   Kafka Connect -> Sinks screen, edit the running Elasticsearch sink
   connector.

4. In the Connect view, pause the Elasticsearch sink connector in Settings by
   pressing the pause icon in the top right. This will stop consumption
   for the related consumer group.

   .. figure:: images/pause_connector.png
      :alt: image

5. View the Alert history to see that this trigger happened and caused
   an alert.

   .. figure:: images/trigger_history.png
      :alt: image


Replicator
----------

Confluent Replicator copies data from a source Kafka cluster to a
destination Kafka cluster. The source and destination clusters are
typically different clusters, but in this demo, Replicator is doing
intra-cluster replication, *i.e.*, the source and destination Kafka
clusters are the same. As with the rest of the components in the
solution, Confluent Replicator is also configured with security.

1. **Consumers**: monitor throughput and latency of Confluent Replicator.
   Replicator is a Kafka Connect source connector and has a corresponding consumer group ``connect-replicator``.

   .. figure:: images/replicator_consumer_group_list.png
      :alt: image

2. View Replicator Consumer Lag.

   .. figure:: images/replicator_consumer_lag.png
      :alt: image

3. View Replicator Consumption metrics.

   .. figure:: images/replicator_consumption.png
      :alt: image

4. **Topics**: scroll down to view the topics called
   ``wikipedia.parsed`` (Replicator is consuming data from this topic)
   and ``wikipedia.parsed.replica`` (Replicator automatically created this topic and is
   copying data to it). Click on ``Consumer Groups`` for the topic
   ``wikipedia.parsed`` and observe that one of the consumer groups is
   called ``connect-replicator``.

   .. figure:: images/replicator_topic_info.png

5. Notice that because |crep| default is ``topic.config.sync=true`` (see |crep| :ref:`documentation <rep-destination-topics>`), then the replicated
   topic ``wikipedia.parsed.replica`` has enabled |sv| just like the original
   topic ``wikipedia.parsed`` (click on the ``Show full config`` button to see all values).
   
   .. figure:: images/wikipedia.parsed.replica.png

6. **MANAGEMENT –> Kafka Connect**: pause the |crep| connector in **Settings**
   by pressing the pause icon in the top right. This will stop
   consumption for the related consumer group.

   .. figure:: images/pause_connector_replicator.png
      :alt: image

7. Observe that the ``connect-replicator`` consumer group has stopped
   consumption.

   .. figure:: images/replicator_streams_stopped.png

8. Restart the Replicator connector.

9. Observe that the ``connect-replicator`` consumer group has resumed
   consumption. Notice several things:

   * Even though the consumer group `connect-replicator` was not running for some of this time, all messages are shown as delivered. This is because all bars are time windows relative to produce timestamp.
   * The latency peaks and then gradually decreases, because this is also relative to the produce timestamp.

Security
--------

Follow along with the `Security <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwuF7cYcsec>`_ video.

All the components in this demo are enabled with many `security
features <https://docs.confluent.io/current/security.html>`__:

-  `SSL <https://docs.confluent.io/current/kafka/authentication_ssl.html>`__
   for encryption, except for ZooKeeper which does not support SSL
-  `SASL/PLAIN <https://docs.confluent.io/current/kafka/authentication_sasl_plain.html>`__
   for authentication, except for ZooKeeper which is configured for `SASL/DIGEST-MD5 <https://docs.confluent.io/current/kafka/authentication_sasl_plain.html#zookeeper>`__
-  `Authorization <https://docs.confluent.io/current/kafka/authorization.html>`__.
   If a resource has no associated ACLs, then users are not allowed to
   access the resource, except super users
-  `HTTPS for Control Center <https://docs.confluent.io/current/control-center/docs/installation/configuration.html#https-settings>`__
-  `HTTPS for Schema Registry <https://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/docs/security.html>`__
-  `HTTPS for Connect <https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/security.html#configuring-the-kconnect-rest-api-for-http-or-https>`__

.. note::
    This demo showcases a secure |CP| for educational purposes and is not meant to be complete best practices. There are certain differences between what is shown in the demo and what you should do in production:

    * Each component should have its own username, instead of authenticating all users as ``client``
    * Authorize users only for operations that they need, instead of making all of them super users
    * If the ``PLAINTEXT`` security protocol is used, these ``ANONYMOUS`` usernames should not be configured as super users
    * Consider not even opening the ``PLAINTEXT`` port if ``SSL`` or ``SASL_SSL`` are configured

---------------------------
Encryption & Authentication
---------------------------

Each broker has four listener ports:

-  PLAINTEXT port called ``PLAINTEXT`` for users with no security
   enabled
-  SSL port port called ``SSL`` for users with just SSL without SASL
-  SASL_SSL port called ``SASL_SSL`` for communication between services
   inside Docker containers
-  SASL_SSL port called ``SASL_SSL_HOST`` for communication between any
   potential services outside of Docker that communicate to the Docker
   containers

+---------------+--------+--------+
| port          | kafka1 | kafka2 |
+===============+========+========+
| PLAINTEXT     | 10091  | 10092  |
+---------------+--------+--------+
| SSL           | 11091  | 11092  |
+---------------+--------+--------+
| SASL_SSL      | 9091   | 9092   |
+---------------+--------+--------+
| SASL_SSL_HOST | 29091  | 29092  |
+---------------+--------+--------+

-------------
Authorization
-------------

All the brokers in this demo authenticate as ``broker``, and all other
services authenticate as their respective names. Per the broker configuration
parameter ``super.users``, as it is set in this demo, the only users
that can communicate with the cluster are those that authenticate as
``broker``, ``schemaregistry``, ``client``, ``restproxy``, ``client``, or users
that connect via the ``PLAINTEXT`` port (their username is ``ANONYMOUS``).
All other users are not authorized to communicate with the cluster.

1. Verify the ports on which the Kafka brokers are listening with the
   following command, and they should match the table shown below:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          docker-compose logs kafka1 | grep "Registered broker 1"
          docker-compose logs kafka2 | grep "Registered broker 2"

2. This demo `automatically
   generates <https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-demo/blob/master/scripts/security/certs-create.sh>`__ simple SSL
   certificates and creates keystores, truststores, and secures them
   with a password. To communicate with the brokers, Kafka clients may
   use any of the ports on which the brokers are listening. To use a
   security-enabled port, they must specify security parameters for
   keystores, truststores, password, or authentication so the Kafka
   command line client tools pass the security configuration file `with
   interceptors <https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-demo/blob/master/scripts/security/client_with_interceptors.config>`__ or
   `without
   interceptors <https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-demo/blob/master/scripts/security/client_without_interceptors.config>`__
   with these security parameters. As an example, to communicate with
   the Kafka cluster to view all the active consumer groups:

   * Communicate with brokers via the PLAINTEXT port

   .. sourcecode:: bash

           # PLAINTEXT port
           docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-consumer-groups --list --bootstrap-server kafka1:10091

   * Communicate with brokers via the SASL_SSL port, and SASL_SSL parameters configured via the ``--command-config`` argument for command line tools or ``--consumer.config`` for kafka-console-consumer.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

           # SASL_SSL port with SASL_SSL parameters
           docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-consumer-groups --list --bootstrap-server kafka1:9091 \
               --command-config /etc/kafka/secrets/client_without_interceptors.config

   * If you try to communicate with brokers via the SASL_SSL port but don’t specify the SASL_SSL parameters, it will fail

   .. sourcecode:: bash

           # SASL_SSL port without SASL_SSL parameters
           docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-consumer-groups --list --bootstrap-server kafka1:9091

   Your output should resemble:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

           Error: Executing consumer group command failed due to Request METADATA failed on brokers List(kafka1:9091 (id: -1 rack: null))


3. Verify which authenticated users are configured to be super users.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

         docker-compose logs kafka1 | grep SUPER_USERS

   Your output should resemble the following. Notice this authorizes each service name which authenticates as itself,
   as well as the unauthenticated ``PLAINTEXT`` which authenticates as ``ANONYMOUS`` (for demo purposes only):

   .. sourcecode:: bash

         KAFKA_SUPER_USERS=User:client;User:schemaregistry;User:restproxy;User:broker;User:connect;User:ANONYMOUS

4. Verify that a user ``client`` which authenticates via SASL can
   consume messages from topic ``wikipedia.parsed``:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          ./scripts/consumers/listen_wikipedia.parsed.sh SASL

5. Verify that a user which authenticates via SSL cannot consume
   messages from topic ``wikipedia.parsed``. It should fail with an exception.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

         ./scripts/consumers/listen_wikipedia.parsed.sh SSL

   Your output should resemble:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

       [2018-01-12 21:13:18,481] ERROR Unknown error when running consumer: (kafka.tools.ConsoleConsumer$)
       org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TopicAuthorizationException: Not authorized to access topics: [wikipedia.parsed]

6. Verify that the broker’s Authorizer logger logs the denial event. As
   shown in the log message, the user which authenticates via SSL has a
   username ``CN=client,OU=TEST,O=CONFLUENT,L=PaloAlto,ST=Ca,C=US``, not
   just ``client``.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

        # Authorizer logger logs the denied operation
        docker-compose logs kafka1 | grep kafka.authorizer.logger


   Your output should resemble:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

        [2018-01-12 21:13:18,454] INFO Principal = User:CN=client,OU=TEST,O=CONFLUENT,L=PaloAlto,ST=Ca,C=US is Denied Operation = Describe from host = 172.23.0.7 on resource = Topic:wikipedia.parsed (kafka.authorizer.logger) [2018-01-12
        21:13:18,464] INFO Principal = User:CN=client,OU=TEST,O=CONFLUENT,L=PaloAlto,ST=Ca,C=US is Denied Operation = Describe from host = 172.23.0.7 on resource = Group:test (kafka.authorizer.logger) 

7. Add an ACL that authorizes user
   ``CN=client,OU=TEST,O=CONFLUENT,L=PaloAlto,ST=Ca,C=US``, and then
   view the updated ACL configuration.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      docker-compose exec kafka1 /usr/bin/kafka-acls \
        --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=zookeeper:2181 \
        --add --topic wikipedia.parsed \
        --allow-principal User:CN=client,OU=TEST,O=CONFLUENT,L=PaloAlto,ST=Ca,C=US \
        --operation Read --group test

      docker-compose exec kafka1 /usr/bin/kafka-acls \
        --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=zookeeper:2181 \
        --list --topic wikipedia.parsed --group test

   Your output should resemble:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

       Current ACLs for resource ``Topic:wikipedia.parsed``:
       User:CN=client,OU=TEST,O=CONFLUENT,L=PaloAlto,ST=Ca,C=US has Allow permission for operations: Read from hosts: \*

       Current ACLs for resource ``Group:test``:
       User:CN=client,OU=TEST,O=CONFLUENT,L=PaloAlto,ST=Ca,C=US has Allow permission for operations: Read from hosts: \* 

8. Verify that the user which authenticates via SSL is now authorized
   and can successfully consume some messages from topic
   ``wikipedia.parsed``.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          ./scripts/consumers/listen_wikipedia.parsed.sh SSL

9. Because ZooKeeper is configured for `SASL/DIGEST-MD5 <https://docs.confluent.io/current/kafka/authentication_sasl_plain.html#zookeeper>`__, 
   any commands that communicate with ZooKeeper need properties set for ZooKeeper authentication. This authentication configuration is provided
   by the ``KAFKA_OPTS`` setting on the brokers. For example, notice that the `throttle script <scripts/app/throttle_consumer.sh>`__ runs on the
   Docker container ``kafka1`` which has the appropriate `KAFKA_OPTS` setting. The command would otherwise fail if run on any other container aside from ``kafka1`` or ``kafka2``.


Data Governance with |sr|
-------------------------

All the applications and connectors used in this demo are configured to automatically read and write Avro-formatted data, leveraging the `Confluent Schema Registry <https://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/docs/index.html>`__ .

1. View the |sr| subjects for topics that have registered schemas for their keys and/or values. Notice the security arguments passed into the ``curl`` command which are required to interact with |sr|, which is listening for HTTPS on port 8085.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

       docker-compose exec schemaregistry curl -X GET --cert /etc/kafka/secrets/schemaregistry.certificate.pem --key /etc/kafka/secrets/schemaregistry.key --tlsv1.2 --cacert /etc/kafka/secrets/snakeoil-ca-1.crt https://schemaregistry:8085/subjects | jq .

   Your output should resemble:

   .. sourcecode:: bash


     [
       "ksql_query_CTAS_EN_WIKIPEDIA_GT_1-KSQL_Agg_Query_1526914100640-changelog-value",
       "ksql_query_CTAS_EN_WIKIPEDIA_GT_1-KSQL_Agg_Query_1526914100640-repartition-value",
       "EN_WIKIPEDIA_GT_1_COUNTS-value",
       "WIKIPEDIABOT-value",
       "EN_WIKIPEDIA_GT_1-value",
       "WIKIPEDIANOBOT-value",
       "wikipedia.parsed-value"
     ]

2. Register a new Avro schema (a record with two fields ``username`` and ``userid``) into |sr| for the value of a new topic ``users``. Note the schema id that it returns, e.g. below schema id is ``6``.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

       docker-compose exec schemaregistry curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.schemaregistry.v1+json" --cert /etc/kafka/secrets/schemaregistry.certificate.pem --key /etc/kafka/secrets/schemaregistry.key --tlsv1.2 --cacert /etc/kafka/secrets/snakeoil-ca-1.crt --data '{ "schema": "[ { \"type\":\"record\", \"name\":\"user\", \"fields\": [ {\"name\":\"userid\",\"type\":\"long\"}, {\"name\":\"username\",\"type\":\"string\"} ]} ]" }' https://schemaregistry:8085/subjects/users-value/versions

   Your output should resemble:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

     {
       "id": 6
     }

3. View the new schema for the subject ``users-value``. From |c3|, click **MANAGEMENT -> Topics**. Scroll down to and click on the topic `users` and select "SCHEMA".

   .. figure:: images/schema1.png
    :alt: image
   
   You may alternatively request the schema via the command line:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

       docker-compose exec schemaregistry curl -X GET --cert /etc/kafka/secrets/schemaregistry.certificate.pem --key /etc/kafka/secrets/schemaregistry.key --tlsv1.2 --cacert /etc/kafka/secrets/snakeoil-ca-1.crt https://schemaregistry:8085/subjects/users-value/versions/1 | jq .

   Your output should resemble:

   .. sourcecode:: bash


     {
       "subject": "users-value",
       "version": 1,
       "id": 6,
       "schema": "{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"user\",\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"username\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"userid\",\"type\":\"long\"}]}"
     }

4. Describe the topic ``users``.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-topics --describe --topic users --bootstrap-server kafka1:9091 --command-config /etc/kafka/secrets/client_without_interceptors.config

   Your output should resemble:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      Topic: users	PartitionCount: 2	ReplicationFactor: 2	Configs: confluent.value.schema.validation=true
	      Topic: users	Partition: 0	Leader: 1	Replicas: 1,2	Isr: 1,2	Offline: 	LiveObservers: 
	      Topic: users	Partition: 1	Leader: 2	Replicas: 2,1	Isr: 2,1	Offline: 	LiveObservers: 


5. Notice that the topic ``users`` has a special configuration ``confluent.value.schema.validation=true`` which enables `Schema Validation <https://docs.confluent.io/current/release-notes/5-4-preview.html>`__, a data governance feature in Confluent Server that gives operators a centralized location within the Kafka cluster itself to enforce data format correctness. Enabling |sv| allows brokers configured with ``confluent.schema.registry.url`` to validate that data produced to the topic is using a valid schema. For example, produce a non-Avro message to this topic, and it will result in a failure.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      docker-compose exec connect kafka-console-producer --topic users --broker-list kafka1:9091 --producer.config /etc/kafka/secrets/client_without_interceptors.config

6. Describe the topic ``wikipedia.parsed``, which is the topic that the `kafka-connect-irc` source connector is writing to. Notice that it also has enabled |sv|.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-topics --describe --topic wikipedia.parsed --bootstrap-server kafka1:9091 --command-config /etc/kafka/secrets/client_without_interceptors.config




Confluent REST Proxy
--------------------

The `Confluent REST Proxy <https://docs.confluent.io/current/kafka-rest/docs/index.html>`__  is running for optional client access.

1. Use the REST Proxy, which is listening for HTTPS on port 8086, to produce a message to the topic ``users``, referencing schema id ``6``. This schema was registered in |sr| in the previous section.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

     docker-compose exec restproxy curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.avro.v2+json" -H "Accept: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json" --cert /etc/kafka/secrets/restproxy.certificate.pem --key /etc/kafka/secrets/restproxy.key --tlsv1.2 --cacert /etc/kafka/secrets/snakeoil-ca-1.crt --data '{"value_schema_id": 6, "records": [{"value": {"user":{"userid": 1, "username": "Bunny Smith"}}}]}' https://restproxy:8086/topics/users

   Your output should resemble:

   .. sourcecode:: bash


     {"offsets":[{"partition":1,"offset":0,"error_code":null,"error":null}],"key_schema_id":null,"value_schema_id":6}

2. Create consumer instance ``my_avro_consumer``.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

       docker-compose exec restproxy curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json" --cert /etc/kafka/secrets/restproxy.certificate.pem --key /etc/kafka/secrets/restproxy.key --tlsv1.2 --cacert /etc/kafka/secrets/snakeoil-ca-1.crt --data '{"name": "my_consumer_instance", "format": "avro", "auto.offset.reset": "earliest"}' https://restproxy:8086/consumers/my_avro_consumer

3. Subscribe my_avro_consumer to the `users` topic

   .. sourcecode:: bash

       docker-compose exec restproxy curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json" --cert /etc/kafka/secrets/restproxy.certificate.pem --key /etc/kafka/secrets/restproxy.key --tlsv1.2 --cacert /etc/kafka/secrets/snakeoil-ca-1.crt --data '{"topics":["users"]}' https://restproxy:8086/consumers/my_avro_consumer/instances/my_consumer_instance/subscription

4. Get messages for my_avro_consumer subscriptions

   .. sourcecode:: bash

       # Note: Issue this command twice due to https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-rest/issues/432
       docker-compose exec restproxy curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/vnd.kafka.avro.v2+json" --cert /etc/kafka/secrets/restproxy.certificate.pem --key /etc/kafka/secrets/restproxy.key --tlsv1.2 --cacert /etc/kafka/secrets/snakeoil-ca-1.crt https://restproxy:8086/consumers/my_avro_consumer/instances/my_consumer_instance/records
       docker-compose exec restproxy curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/vnd.kafka.avro.v2+json" --cert /etc/kafka/secrets/restproxy.certificate.pem --key /etc/kafka/secrets/restproxy.key --tlsv1.2 --cacert /etc/kafka/secrets/snakeoil-ca-1.crt https://restproxy:8086/consumers/my_avro_consumer/instances/my_consumer_instance/records

5. Delete the consumer instance ``my_avro_consumer``.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

       docker-compose exec restproxy curl -X DELETE -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json" --cert /etc/kafka/secrets/restproxy.certificate.pem --key /etc/kafka/secrets/restproxy.key --tlsv1.2 --cacert /etc/kafka/secrets/snakeoil-ca-1.crt https://restproxy:8086/consumers/my_avro_consumer/instances/my_consumer_instance


========================
Troubleshooting the demo
========================

1. Verify the status of the Docker containers show ``Up`` state, except for the ``kafka-client`` container which is expected to have ``Exit 0`` state. If any containers are not up, verify in the advanced Docker preferences settings that the memory available to Docker is at least 8 GB (default is 2 GB).

   .. sourcecode:: bash

        docker-compose ps

   Your output should resemble:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

2. To view sample messages for each topic, including
   ``wikipedia.parsed``:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          ./scripts/consumers/listen.sh

3. If the data streams monitoring appears to stop for the Kafka source
   connector, restart the connect container.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          docker-compose restart connect

4. If a command that communicates with ZooKeeper appears to be failing with the error ``org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException$NoAuthException``,
   change the container you are running the command from to be either ``kafka1`` or ``kafka2``.  This is because ZooKeeper is configured for
   `SASL/DIGEST-MD5 <https://docs.confluent.io/current/kafka/authentication_sasl_plain.html#zookeeper>`__, and
   any commands that communicate with ZooKeeper need properties set for ZooKeeper authentication.

      
========
Teardown
========

1. Stop the consumer group ``app`` to stop consuming from topic
   ``wikipedia.parsed``. Note that the command below stops the consumers
   gracefully with ``kill -15``, so the consumers follow the shutdown
   sequence.

   .. code:: bash

         ./scripts/app/stop_consumer_app_group_graceful.sh

2. Stop the Docker demo, destroy all components and clear all Docker
   volumes.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          ./scripts/stop.sh
