.. _cp-demo:

Confluent Platform Demo (cp-demo)
=================================

This example builds a full |cp| deployment with an |ak-tm| event streaming application using `ksqlDB <https://ksqldb.io>`__ and `Kafka Streams <https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/index.html>`__ for stream processing, and all the components have security enabled end-to-end.
Follow the accompanying guided tutorial, broken down step-by-step, to learn how |ak| works all together with |kconnect|, |sr-long|, |c3|, |crep|, and security enabled end-to-end.
The tutorial includes a module to extend it into a hybrid deployment that runs |crep| to copy data from a local on-prem |ak| cluster to |ccloud|, a fully-managed service for |ak-tm|.

========
Overview
========

Use Case
--------

The use case is an |ak-tm| event streaming application that processes real-time edits to real Wikipedia pages.

.. figure:: images/cp-demo-overview.jpg
    :alt: image

The full event streaming platform based on |cp| is described as follows.
Wikimedia's `EventStreams <https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Event_Platform/EventStreams>`__ publishes a continuous stream of real-time edits happening to real wiki pages.
A Kafka source connector `kafka-connect-sse <https://www.confluent.io/hub/cjmatta/kafka-connect-sse>`__ streams the server-sent events (SSE) from https://stream.wikimedia.org/v2/stream/recentchange, and a custom |kconnect| transform `kafka-connect-json-schema <https://www.confluent.io/hub/jcustenborder/kafka-connect-json-schema>`__ extracts the JSON from these messages and then are written to a |ak| cluster.
This example uses `ksqlDB <https://ksqldb.io>`__ and a :ref:`Kafka Streams <kafka_streams>` application for data processing.
Then a Kafka sink connector `kafka-connect-elasticsearch <http://docs.confluent.io/kafka-connect-elasticsearch/index.html>`__ streams the data out of Kafka and is materialized into `Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch>`__ for analysis by `Kibana <https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana>`__.
|crep-full| is also copying messages from a topic to another topic in the same cluster.
All data is using |sr-long| and Avro, and `Confluent Control Center <https://www.confluent.io/product/control-center/>`__ is managing and monitoring the deployment.

How to use this tutorial
------------------------

We suggest following the ``cp-demo`` tutorial in order:

#. :ref:`cp-demo-run`: one script to automatically build the entire end-to-end example

#. :ref:`cp-demo-guide`: explore the different areas of |cp|

#. :ref:`cp-demo-hybrid`: run |crep| to copy data from a local on-prem |ak| cluster to |ccloud|, and use the Metrics API to monitor both

#. :ref:`cp-demo-monitoring`: links to other monitoring solutions, including JMX-based ones

#. :ref:`cp-demo-teardown`: clean up your on-prem and |ccloud| environment


.. _cp-demo-run:

===========
Run cp-demo
===========

``cp-demo`` is a Docker environment and has all services running on one host.
It is meant exclusively to easily demo |CP|, but in production, do not deploy all |cp| services on a single host.

Also, in production, |c3| should be deployed with a valid license and with its own dedicated metrics cluster, separate from the cluster with production data.
Using a dedicated metrics cluster is more resilient because it continues to provide system health monitoring even if the production traffic cluster experiences issues.

If you prefer non-Docker examples, please go to `confluentinc/examples GitHub repository <https://github.com/confluentinc/examples>`__.

After you run through the guided tutorial below, apply the concepts you learn here to build your own event streaming pipeline in |ccloud|, a fully managed, cloud-native event streaming platform powered by |ak|. When you sign up for `Confluent Cloud <https://confluent.cloud>`__, use the promo code ``C50INTEG`` to receive an additional $50 free usage (`details <https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud-promo-disclaimer>`__).


Prerequisites
-------------

This example has been validated with:

-  Docker version 17.06.1-ce
-  Docker Compose version 1.16.0 with Docker Compose file format 2.3
-  Java version 1.8.0_92
-  MacOS 10.15.3 (note for `Ubuntu environments <https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-demo/issues/53>`__)
-  OpenSSL 1.1.1d
-  git
-  curl
-  jq

Setup
-----

#. In Docker's advanced `settings <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#advanced>`__, increase the memory dedicated to Docker to at least 8 GB (default is 2 GB) and ensure Docker is allocated at least 2 CPU cores.

#. Clone the `confluentinc/cp-demo GitHub repository <https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-demo>`__:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

       git clone https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-demo

#. Navigate to the ``cp-demo`` directory and switch to the |cp| release branch:

   .. codewithvars:: bash

      cd cp-demo
      git checkout |release_post_branch|


Start
-----

Within the ``cp-demo`` directory, there is a single :devx-cp-demo:`script|scripts/start.sh` that runs the ``cp-demo`` workflow end-to-end.
It generates the keys and certificates, brings up the Docker containers, and configures and validates the environment.
You can run it with optional settings:

- ``CLEAN``: controls whether certificates and the locally built |kconnect| image are regenerated in between runs
- ``C3_KSQLDB_HTTPS``: controls whether |c3| and ksqlDB server use ``HTTP`` or ``HTTPS`` (default: ``false`` for ``HTTP``)
- ``VIZ``: enables Elasticsearch and Kibana (default: ``true``)

#. To run ``cp-demo`` the first time with defaults, run the following command. This takes a few minutes to complete.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      ./scripts/start.sh

#. On subsequent runs, if you have not deleted the generated certificates and the locally built |kconnect| image, they will be reused. To force them to be regenerated, you can set ``CLEAN=true``.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      CLEAN=true ./scripts/start.sh

#. ``cp-demo`` supports access to the |c3| GUI via either ``http://`` (the default) or secure ``https://``, the latter employing a self-signed CA and certificates generated during deployment. Due to |c3| integrations to other components include ksqlDB server, only one mode at a time is fully supported. To run ``cp-demo`` in ``https`` mode, set ``C3_KSQLDB_HTTPS=true`` when starting ``cp-demo``:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      C3_KSQLDB_HTTPS=true ./scripts/start.sh

#. Elasticsearch and Kibana increase localhost memory requirements for ``cp-demo``. For users who want to run ``cp-demo`` with a smaller memory footprint, opt-out of these components by setting ``VIZ=false`` when starting ``cp-demo``.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      VIZ=false ./scripts/start.sh

#. After the start script completes, run through the pre-flight checks below and follow the guided tutorial through this on-prem deployment.


Pre-flight Checks
-----------------

Before going through the tutorial, check that the environment has started correctly.
If any of these pre-flight checks fails, consult the :ref:`cp-demo-troubleshooting` section.

#. Verify the status of the Docker containers show ``Up`` state.

   .. code-block:: bash

        docker-compose ps

   Your output should resemble:

   .. code-block:: text

Log into |c3| 
-------------

#. If you ran ``cp-demo`` with ``C3_KSQLDB_HTTPS=false`` (which is the default), log into the |c3| GUI from a web browser at the following URL:

   .. code-block:: text

      http://localhost:9021

#. If you ran ``cp-demo`` with ``C3_KSQLDB_HTTPS=true``, log into the |c3| GUI from a web browser at the following URL:

   .. code-block:: text

      https://localhost:9022

   The browser will detect a self-signed, untrusted certificate and certificate authority, and issue a privacy warning as shown below. To proceed, accept this certificate using your browser's process for this, which will then last for the duration of that browser session.

   - _Chrome_: click on ``Advanced`` and when the window expands, click on ``Proceed to localhost (unsafe)``.

     .. figure:: images/c3-chrome-cert-warning.png
        :width: 500px

   - _Safari_: open a new private browsing window (``Shift + ⌘ + N``), click on ``Show Details`` and when the window expands, click on ``visit this website``.

     .. figure:: images/c3-safari-cert-warning.png
        :width: 500px

#. At the login screen, log into |c3| as ``superUser`` and password ``superUser``, which has super user access to the cluster. You may also log in as :devx-cp-demo:`other users|scripts//security/ldap_users` to learn how each user's view changes depending on their permissions.

   .. figure:: images/c3-login.png
      :width: 500px


Brokers 
-------

#. Select the cluster named "Kafka Raleigh".

   .. figure:: images/cluster_raleigh.png
      :width: 500px

#. Click on "Brokers".

#. View the status of the brokers in the cluster:

   .. figure:: images/landing_page.png

#. Click through on Production or Consumption to view: Production and Consumption metrics, Broker uptime, Partitions: online, under replicated, total replicas, out of sync replicas, Disk utilization, System: network pool usage, request pool usage.

   .. figure:: images/broker_metrics.png




Topics
------

#. |c3| can manage topics in a Kafka cluster. Click on "Topics".

#. Scroll down and click on the topic ``wikipedia.parsed``.

   .. figure:: images/topic_list_wikipedia.png
         :alt: image

#. View an overview of this topic:

   - Throughput
   - Partition replication status

#. Return to "All Topics", click on ``wikipedia.parsed.count-by-domain`` to view the output topic from the |kstreams| application.

   .. figure:: images/count-topic-view.png
      :alt: image

#. Return to the ``All topics`` view and click the **+ Add a topic** button on the top right to create a new topic in your Kafka cluster. You can also view and edit settings of Kafka topics in the cluster. Read more on |c3| :ref:`topic management <controlcenter_userguide_topics>`.

   .. figure:: images/create_topic.png
         :alt: image

|kconnect-long|
---------------

This example runs three connectors:

- SSE source connector
- Elasticsearch sink connector
- |crep-full|

They are running on a |kconnect| worker that is configured with |cp| security features.
The |kconnect| worker's embedded producer is configured to be idempotent, exactly-once in order semantics per partition (in the event of an error that causes a producer retry, the same message—which is still sent by the producer multiple times—will only be written to the Kafka log on the broker once).

#. The |kconnect-long| Docker container is running a custom image. Its base image is ``cp-enterprise-replicator``, which bundles |kconnect| and |crep|, and on top of that, it has a specific set of connectors and transformations needed by ``cp-demo``. See :devx-cp-demo:`this Dockerfile|Dockerfile` for more details.

#. |c3| uses the |kconnect-long| API to manage multiple :ref:`connect clusters <kafka_connect>`.  Click on "Connect".

#. Select ``connect1``, the name of the cluster of |kconnect| workers.

   .. figure:: images/connect_default.png

#. Verify the connectors running in this example:

   - source connector ``wikipedia-sse``: view the example's SSE source connector :devx-cp-demo:`configuration file|scripts/connectors/submit_wikipedia_sse_config.sh`.
   - source connector ``replicate-topic``: view the example's |crep| connector :devx-cp-demo:`configuration file|scripts/connectors/submit_replicator_config.sh`.
   - sink connector ``elasticsearch-ksqldb`` consuming from the Kafka topic ``WIKIPEDIABOT``: view the example's Elasticsearch sink connector :devx-cp-demo:`configuration file|scripts/connectors/submit_elastic_sink_config.sh`.

   .. figure:: images/connector_list.png

#. Click any connector name to view or modify any details of the connector configuration and custom transforms.

   .. figure:: images/connect_replicator_settings.png


.. _ksql-demo-3:

ksqlDB
------

In this example, ksqlDB is authenticated and authorized to connect to the secured Kafka cluster, and it is already running queries as defined in the :devx-cp-demo:`ksqlDB command file|scripts/ksqlDB/statements.sql`.
Its embedded producer is configured to be idempotent, exactly-once in order semantics per partition (in the event of an error that causes a producer retry, the same message—which is still sent by the producer multiple times—will only be written to the Kafka log on the broker once).

#. In the navigation bar, click **ksqlDB**.

#. From the list of ksqlDB applications, select ``wikipedia``.

   .. figure:: images/ksql_link.png
      :alt: image

#. View the ksqlDB Flow to see the streams and tables created in the example, and how they relate to one another.

   .. figure:: images/ksqldb_flow.png
      :alt: image

#. Use |c3| to interact with ksqlDB, or run ksqlDB CLI to get to the ksqlDB CLI prompt.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

        docker-compose exec ksqldb-cli bash -c 'ksql -u ksqlDBUser -p ksqlDBUser http://ksqldb-server:8088'

#. View the existing ksqlDB streams. (If you are using the ksqlDB CLI, at the ``ksql>`` prompt type ``SHOW STREAMS;``)

   .. figure:: images/ksql_streams_list.png
      :alt: image

#. Click on ``WIKIPEDIA`` to describe the schema (fields or columns) of an existing ksqlDB stream. (If you are using the ksqlDB CLI, at the ``ksql>`` prompt type ``DESCRIBE WIKIPEDIA;``)

   .. figure:: images/wikipedia_describe.png
      :width: 600px
      :alt: image

#. View the existing ksqlDB tables. (If you are using the ksqlDB CLI, at the ``ksql>`` prompt type ``SHOW TABLES;``). One table is called ``WIKIPEDIA_COUNT_GT_1``, which counts occurrences within a `tumbling window <https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/concepts/time-and-windows-in-ksqldb-queries/#tumbling-window>`__.

   .. figure:: images/ksql_tables_list.png
      :alt: image

#. View the existing ksqlDB queries, which are continuously running. (If you are using the ksqlDB CLI, at the ``ksql>`` prompt type ``SHOW QUERIES;``).

   .. figure:: images/ksql_queries_list.png
      :alt: image

#. View messages from different ksqlDB streams and tables. Click on your stream of choice and then click **Query stream** to open the Query Editor. The editor shows a pre-populated query, like ``select * from WIKIPEDIA EMIT CHANGES;``, and it shows results for newly arriving data.

   .. figure:: images/ksql_query_topic.png
      :width: 600px

#. Click **ksqlDB Editor** and run the ``SHOW PROPERTIES;`` statement. You can see the configured ksqlDB server properties and check these values with the :devx-cp-demo:`docker-compose.yml|docker-compose.yml` file.

   .. figure:: images/ksql_properties.png
      :alt: image

#. The `ksqlDB processing log <https://docs.confluent.io/current/ksql/docs/developer-guide/processing-log.html>`__ captures per-record errors during processing to help developers debug their ksqlDB queries. In this example, the processing log uses mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication, as configured in the custom :devx-cp-demo:`log4j properties file|scripts/helper/log4j-secure.properties`, to write entries into a Kafka topic. To see it in action, in the ksqlDB editor run the following "bad" query for 20 seconds:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      SELECT ucase(cast(null as varchar)) FROM wikipedia EMIT CHANGES;

   No records should be returned from this query. ksqlDB writes errors into the processing log for each record. View the processing log topic ``ksql-clusterksql_processing_log`` with topic inspection (jump to offset 0/partition 0) or the corresponding ksqlDB stream ``KSQL_PROCESSING_LOG`` with the ksqlDB editor (set ``auto.offset.reset=earliest``).

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      SELECT * FROM KSQL_PROCESSING_LOG EMIT CHANGES;


Consumers
---------

#. |c3| enables you to monitor consumer lag and throughput performance. Consumer lag is the topic's high water mark (latest offset for the topic that has been written) minus the current consumer offset (latest offset read for that topic by that consumer group). Keep in mind the topic's write rate and consumer group's read rate when you consider the significance the consumer lag's size. Click on "Consumers".

#. Consumer lag is available on a `per-consumer basis <https://docs.confluent.io/current/control-center/consumers.html#view-consumer-lag-details-for-a-consumer-group>`__, including the embedded Connect consumers for sink connectors (e.g., ``connect-elasticsearch-ksqldb``), ksqlDB queries (e.g., consumer groups whose names start with ``_confluent-ksql-default_query_``), console consumers (e.g., ``WIKIPEDIANOBOT-consumer``), etc.  Consumer lag is also available on a `per-topic basis <https://docs.confluent.io/current/control-center/topics/view.html#view-consumer-lag-for-a-topic>`__.

   .. figure:: images/consumer_group_list.png
      :alt: image

#. View consumer lag for the persistent ksqlDB "Create Stream As Select" query ``CSAS_WIKIPEDIABOT``, which is displayed as ``_confluent-ksql-ksql-clusterquery_CSAS_WIKIPEDIABOT_5`` in the consumer group list.

   .. figure:: images/ksql_query_CSAS_WIKIPEDIABOT_consumer_lag.png
      :alt: image

#. View consumer lag for the |kstreams| application under the consumer group id ``wikipedia-activity-monitor``. This application is run by the `cnfldemos/cp-demo-kstreams <https://hub.docker.com/r/cnfldemos/cp-demo-kstreams>`__ Docker container (application :devx-cp-demo:`source code|kstreams-app/src/main/java/io/confluent/demos/common/wiki/WikipediaActivityMonitor.java`). The |kstreams| application is configured to connect to the |ak| cluster with the following :devx-cp-demo:`client configuration|env_files/streams-demo.env` file.

   .. figure:: images/activity-monitor-consumer.png
      :alt: image

#. Consumption metrics are available on a `per-consumer basis <https://docs.confluent.io/current/control-center/consumers.html#view-consumption-details-for-a-consumer-group>`__. These consumption charts are only populated if `Confluent Monitoring Interceptors <https://docs.confluent.io/current/control-center/installation/clients.html>`__ are configured, as they are in this example. You can view ``% messages consumed`` and ``end-to-end latency``.  View consumption metrics for the persistent ksqlDB "Create Stream As Select" query ``CSAS_WIKIPEDIABOT``, which is displayed as ``_confluent-ksql-default_query_CSAS_WIKIPEDIABOT_0`` in the consumer group list.

   .. figure:: images/ksql_query_CSAS_WIKIPEDIABOT_consumption.png
      :alt: image

#. |c3| shows which consumers in a consumer group are consuming from which partitions and on which brokers those partitions reside.  |c3| updates as consumer rebalances occur in a consumer group.  Start consuming from topic ``wikipedia.parsed`` with a new consumer group ``app`` with one consumer ``consumer_app_1``. It runs in the background.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          ./scripts/app/start_consumer_app.sh 1

#. Let this consumer group run for 2 minutes until |c3|
   shows the consumer group ``app`` with steady consumption.
   This consumer group ``app`` has a single consumer ``consumer_app_1`` consuming all of the partitions in the topic ``wikipedia.parsed``. 

   .. figure:: images/consumer_start_one.png
      :alt: image

#. Add a second consumer ``consumer_app_2`` to the existing consumer
   group ``app``.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          ./scripts/app/start_consumer_app.sh 2

#. Let this consumer group run for 2 minutes until |c3|
   shows the consumer group ``app`` with steady consumption.
   Notice that the consumers ``consumer_app_1`` and ``consumer_app_2``
   now share consumption of the partitions in the topic
   ``wikipedia.parsed``.

|crep-full|
-----------

|crep-full| copies data from a source Kafka cluster to a
destination Kafka cluster. The source and destination clusters are
typically different clusters, but in this example, |crep| is doing
intra-cluster replication, *i.e.*, the source and destination Kafka
clusters are the same. As with the rest of the components in the
solution, |crep-full| is also configured with security.

#. View |crep| status and throughput in a dedicated view in |c3|.

   .. figure:: images/replicator_c3_view.png
      :alt: image

#. **Consumers**: monitor throughput and latency of |crep-full|.
   |crep| is a |kconnect-long| source connector and has a corresponding consumer group ``connect-replicator``.

#. View |crep| Consumption metrics.

   .. figure:: images/replicator_consumption.png
      :alt: image

#. **Connect**: pause the |crep| connector in **Settings**
   by pressing the pause icon in the top right and wait for 10 seconds until it takes effect.  This stops
   consumption for the related consumer group.

   .. figure:: images/pause_connector_replicator.png
      :alt: image

#. Observe that the ``connect-replicator`` consumer group has stopped
   consumption.

   .. figure:: images/replicator_stopped.png

#. Restart the |crep| connector.

#. Observe that the ``connect-replicator`` consumer group has resumed consumption. Notice several things:

   * Even though the consumer group `connect-replicator` was not running for some of this time, all messages are shown as delivered. This is because all bars are time windows relative to produce timestamp.
   * The latency peaks and then gradually decreases, because this is also relative to the produce timestamp.

#. Next step: Learn more about |crep| with the :ref:`Replicator Tutorial <replicator>`.


Security
--------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

All the |cp| components and clients in this example are enabled with many :ref:`security features <security>`.

-  :ref:`Metadata Service (MDS) <rbac-mds-config>` which is the central authority for authentication and authorization. It is configured with the |csa| and talks to LDAP to authenticate clients.
-  :ref:`SSL <kafka_ssl_authentication>` for encryption and mTLS. The example :devx-cp-demo:`automatically generates|scripts/security/certs-create.sh` SSL certificates and creates keystores, truststores, and secures them with a password. 
-  :ref:`Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) <rbac-overview>` for authorization. If a resource has no associated ACLs, then users are not allowed to access the resource, except super users.
-  |zk| is configured for :ref`SSL <zk-mtls>` AND `SASL/DIGEST-MD5 <zk-auth-sasl>` (Note: no |crest| and |sr| TLS support with `trial licenses <https://docs.confluent.io/5.5.0/release-notes/index.html#schema-registry>`__).
-  :ref:`HTTPS for Control Center <https_settings>`.
-  :ref:`HTTPS for Schema Registry <schemaregistry_security>`.
-  :ref:`HTTPS for Connect <connect_security>`.

You can see each component's security configuration in the example's :devx-cp-demo:`docker-compose.yml|docker-compose.yml` file.

.. note::
    This example showcases a secure |CP| for educational purposes and is not meant to be complete best practices. There are certain differences between what is shown in the example and what you should do in production:

    * Authorize users only for operations that they need, instead of making all of them super users
    * If the ``PLAINTEXT`` security protocol is used, these ``ANONYMOUS`` usernames should not be configured as super users
    * Consider not even opening the ``PLAINTEXT`` port if ``SSL`` or ``SASL_SSL`` are configured

There is an OpenLDAP server running in the example, and each Kafka broker in the demo is configured with |mds-long| and can talk to LDAP so that it can authenticate clients and |cp| services and clients.

|zk| has two listener ports:

+---------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------+
| Name          | Protocol       | In this example, used for ...                                      | ZooKeeper       |
+===============+================+====================================================================+=================+
| N/A           | SASL/DIGEST-MD5| Validating trial license for |crest| and |sr|. (no TLS support)    | 2181            |
+---------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------+
| N/A           | mTLS           | Broker communication (kafka1, kafka2)                              | 2182            |
+---------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------+



Each broker has five listener ports:

+---------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+--------+--------+
| Name          | Protocol       | In this example, used for ...                                      | kafka1 | kafka2 |
+===============+================+====================================================================+========+========+
| N/A           | MDS            | Authorization via RBAC                                             | 8091   | 8092   |
+---------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+--------+--------+
| INTERNAL      | SASL_PLAINTEXT | CP Kafka clients (e.g. Confluent Metrics Reporter), SASL_PLAINTEXT | 9091   | 9092   |

+---------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+--------+--------+
| SSL           | SSL            | End clients, (e.g. `stream-demo`), with SSL no SASL                | 11091  | 11092  |
+---------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+--------+--------+
| CLEAR         | PLAINTEXT      | No security, available as a backdoor; for demo and learning only   | 12091  | 12092  |
+---------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+--------+--------+

End clients (non-CP clients):

- Authenticate using mTLS via the broker SSL listener.
- If they are also using |sr|, authenticate to |sr| via LDAP.
- If they are also using Confluent Monitoring interceptors, authenticate using mTLS via the broker SSL listener.
- Should never use the TOKEN listener which is meant only for internal communication between Confluent components.
- See :devx-cp-demo:`client configuration|env_files/streams-demo.env/` used in the example by the ``streams-demo`` container running the |kstreams| application ``wikipedia-activity-monitor``.

Broker Listeners
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Verify the ports on which the Kafka brokers are listening with the
   following command, and they should match the table shown below:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          docker-compose logs kafka1 | grep "Registered broker 1"
          docker-compose logs kafka2 | grep "Registered broker 2"

#. For example only: Communicate with brokers via the PLAINTEXT port, client security configurations are not required

   .. sourcecode:: bash

           # CLEAR/PLAINTEXT port
           docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-consumer-groups \
              --list \
              --bootstrap-server kafka1:12091

#. End clients: Communicate with brokers via the SSL port, and SSL parameters configured via the ``--command-config`` argument for command line tools or ``--consumer.config`` for kafka-console-consumer.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

           # SSL/SSL port
           docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-consumer-groups \
              --list \
              --bootstrap-server kafka1:11091 \
              --command-config /etc/kafka/secrets/client_without_interceptors_ssl.config

#. If a client tries to communicate with brokers via the SSL port but does not specify the SSL parameters, it fails

   .. sourcecode:: bash

           # SSL/SSL port
           docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-consumer-groups \
              --list \
              --bootstrap-server kafka1:11091

   Your output should resemble:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

           ERROR Uncaught exception in thread 'kafka-admin-client-thread | adminclient-1': (org.apache.kafka.common.utils.KafkaThread)
           java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
           ...

#. Communicate with brokers via the SASL_PLAINTEXT port, and SASL_PLAINTEXT parameters configured via the ``--command-config`` argument for command line tools or ``--consumer.config`` for kafka-console-consumer.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

           # INTERNAL/SASL_PLAIN port
           docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-consumer-groups \
              --list \
              --bootstrap-server kafka1:9091 \
              --command-config /etc/kafka/secrets/client_sasl_plain.config

Authorization with RBAC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Verify which users are configured to be super users.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

         docker-compose logs kafka1 | grep "super.users ="

   Your output should resemble the following. Notice this authorizes each service name which authenticates as itself,
   as well as the unauthenticated ``PLAINTEXT`` which authenticates as ``ANONYMOUS`` (for demo purposes only):

   .. sourcecode:: bash

         kafka1            | 	super.users = User:admin;User:mds;User:superUser;User:ANONYMOUS

#. From the |c3| UI, in the Administration menu, click the *Manage role assignments* option. Click on ``Assignments`` and then the Kafka cluster ID. From the ``Topic`` list, verify that the LDAP user ``appSA`` is allowed to access a few topics, including any topic whose name starts with ``wikipedia``. This role assignment was done during ``cp-demo`` startup in the :devx-cp-demo:`create-role-bindings.sh script|scripts/helper/create-role-bindings.sh`.

   .. figure:: images/appSA_topic_assignments.png

#. Verify that LDAP user ``appSA`` (which is not a super user) can consume messages from topic ``wikipedia.parsed``.  Notice that it is configured to authenticate to brokers with mTLS and authenticate to |sr| with LDAP.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

         docker-compose exec connect kafka-avro-console-consumer \
           --bootstrap-server kafka1:11091,kafka2:11092 \
           --consumer-property security.protocol=SSL \

           --max-messages 5

#. Verify that LDAP user ``badapp`` cannot consume messages from topic ``wikipedia.parsed``.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

         docker-compose exec connect kafka-avro-console-consumer \
           --bootstrap-server kafka1:11091,kafka2:11092 \

           --group wikipedia.test \
           --topic wikipedia.parsed \
           --max-messages 5

   Your output should resemble:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      ERROR [Consumer clientId=consumer-wikipedia.test-1, groupId=wikipedia.test] Topic authorization failed for topics [wikipedia.parsed]
      org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TopicAuthorizationException: Not authorized to access topics: [wikipedia.parsed]

#. Because |zk| is configured for :ref:`SASL/DIGEST-MD5 <kafka_sasl_auth_plain>`, any commands that communicate with |zk| need properties set for |zk| authentication. This authentication configuration is provided by the ``KAFKA_OPTS`` setting on the brokers. For example, notice that the :devx-cp-demo:`consumer throttle script|scripts/app/throttle_consumer.sh` runs on the Docker container ``kafka1`` which has the appropriate `KAFKA_OPTS` setting. The command would otherwise fail if run on any other container aside from ``kafka1`` or ``kafka2``.

#. Next step: Learn more about security with the :ref:`Security Tutorial <security_tutorial>`.


Data Governance with |sr|
-------------------------

All the applications and connectors used in this example are configured to automatically read and write Avro-formatted data, leveraging the :ref:`Confluent Schema Registry <schemaregistry_intro>`.

The security in place between |sr| and the end clients, e.g. ``appSA``, is as follows:

- Encryption: TLS, e.g. client has ``schema.registry.ssl.truststore.*`` configurations
- Authentication: bearer token authentication from HTTP basic auth headers, e.g. client has ``basic.auth.user.info`` and ``basic.auth.credentials.source`` configurations
- Authorization: |sr| uses the bearer token with RBAC to authorize the client


#. View the |sr| subjects for topics that have registered schemas for their keys and/or values. Notice the ``curl`` arguments include (a) TLS information required to interact with |sr| which is listening for HTTPS on port 8085, and (b) authentication credentials required for RBAC (using `superUser:superUser` to see all of them).

   .. code-block:: text

       docker-compose exec schemaregistry curl -X GET \
          --tlsv1.2 \
          --cacert /etc/kafka/secrets/snakeoil-ca-1.crt \
          -u superUser:superUser \
          https://schemaregistry:8085/subjects | jq .

   Your output should resemble:

#. Describe the topic ``users``. Notice that it has a special configuration ``confluent.value.schema.validation=true`` which enables :ref:`Schema Validation <schema_validation>`,  a data governance feature in Confluent Server that gives operators a centralized location within the Kafka cluster itself to enforce data format correctness.

|crest-long|
------------

The :ref:`Confluent REST Proxy <kafkarest_intro>`  is running for optional client access.
This demo showcases |crest-long| in two modes:

- Standalone service, listening for HTTPS requests on port 8086
- Embedded service on the |ak| brokers, listening for HTTPS requests on port 8091 on ``kafka1`` and on port 8092 on ``kafka2`` (these |crest| ports are shared with the broker's |mds-long| listener)

Standalone |crest|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the next few steps, use the |crest| that is running as a standalone service.

#. Use the standalone |crest| to try to produce a message to the topic ``users``, referencing schema id ``11``. This schema was registered in |sr| in the previous section. It should fail due to an authorization error.

Embedded |crest|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the next few steps, use the |crest| that is embedded on the |ak| brokers. Only :ref:`rest-proxy-v3` is supported this time.

#. Create a role binding for the client to be granted ``ResourceOwner`` role for the topic ``dev_users``.

   Get the |ak| cluster ID:

   .. literalinclude:: includes/get_kafka_cluster_id_from_host.sh

   Create the role binding:

   .. code-block:: text

      # Create the role binding for the topic ``dev_users``
      docker-compose exec tools bash -c "confluent iam rolebinding create \
          --principal User:appSA \
          --role ResourceOwner \
          --resource Topic:dev_users \
          --kafka-cluster-id $KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID"

#. Create the topic ``dev_users`` with embedded |crest|.

   Get the |ak| cluster ID:

   .. literalinclude:: includes/get_kafka_cluster_id_from_host.sh

   Use ``curl`` to create the topic:

   .. code-block:: text

      docker-compose exec restproxy curl -X POST \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -H "accept: application/json" \

         -u appSA:appSA \
         "https://kafka1:8091/kafka/v3/clusters/${KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID}/topics" | jq

#. List topics with embedded |crest| to find the newly created ``dev_users``.

   Get the |ak| cluster ID:

   .. literalinclude:: includes/get_kafka_cluster_id_from_host.sh

   Use ``curl`` to list the topics:

   .. code-block:: text

      docker-compose exec restproxy curl -X GET \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -H "accept: application/json" \

         --cacert /etc/kafka/secrets/snakeoil-ca-1.crt \
         -u appSA:appSA \
         https://kafka1:8091/kafka/v3/clusters/${KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID}/topics | jq '.data[].topic_name'

   Your output should resemble below.  Output may vary, depending on other topics you may have created, but at least you should see the topic ``dev_users`` created in the previous step.

   .. code-block:: text

      "_confluent-monitoring"
      "dev_users"
      "users"

Failed Broker
-------------

To simulate a failed broker, stop the Docker container running one of
the two Kafka brokers.

#. Stop the Docker container running Kafka broker 2.

   .. code-block:: bash

          docker-compose stop kafka2

#. After a few minutes, observe the Broker summary show that the number of brokers 
   has decreased from 2 to 1, and there are many under replicated
   partitions.

   .. figure:: images/broker_down_failed.png
      :alt: image

#. View Topic information details to see that there are out of sync replicas.

   .. figure:: images/broker_down_replicas.png
      :alt: image

#. Look at the production and consumption metrics and notice that the clients are all still working.

   .. figure:: images/broker_down_apps_working.png
      :alt: image

#. Restart the Docker container running Kafka broker 2.

   .. code-block:: bash

          docker-compose start kafka2

#. After about a minute, observe the Broker summary in |c3|.
   The broker count has recovered to 2, and the topic
   partitions are back to reporting no under replicated partitions.

   .. figure:: images/broker_down_steady.png
      :alt: image

#. Click on the broker count ``2`` inside the "Brokers" box and when
   the "Brokers overview" pane appears, click inside the "Partitioning
   and replication" box to view when broker counts changed.

   .. figure:: images/broker_down_times.png
      :width: 600px
      :alt: image


Alerting
--------

There are many types of |c3-short|
:ref:`alerts <controlcenter_userguide_alerts>`
and many ways to configure them. Use the Alerts management page to
define triggers and actions, or click on individual resources
to setup alerts from there.

.. figure:: images/c3-alerts-bell-icon-initial.png
   :alt: image


#. This example already has pre-configured triggers and actions. View the
   Alerts ``Triggers`` screen, and click ``Edit`` against each trigger
   to see configuration details.

   -  The trigger ``Under Replicated Partitions`` happens when a broker
      reports non-zero under replicated partitions, and it causes an
      action ``Email Administrator``.
   -  The trigger ``Consumption Difference`` happens when consumption
      difference for the Elasticsearch connector consumer group is
      greater than ``0``, and it causes an action
      ``Email Administrator``.

   .. figure:: images/alerts_triggers.png
      :alt: image

#. If you followed the steps in the `failed broker <#failed-broker>`__
   section, view the Alert history to see that the trigger
   ``Under Replicated Partitions`` happened and caused an alert when you
   stopped broker 2.


   .. figure:: images/alerts_triggers_under_replication_partitions.png
      :alt: image


#. You can also trigger the ``Consumption Difference`` trigger. In the
   Kafka Connect -> Sinks screen, edit the running Elasticsearch sink
   connector.

#. In the Connect view, pause the Elasticsearch sink connector in Settings by
   pressing the pause icon in the top right. This stops consumption
   for the related consumer group.

   .. figure:: images/pause_connector.png
      :alt: image

#. View the Alert history to see that this trigger happened and caused
   an alert.

Hybrid Deployment to |ccloud|
=============================

In a hybrid |ak-tm| deployment scenario, you can have both an on-prem and `Confluent Cloud <https://confluent.cloud>`__ deployment.
In this part of the tutorial, you can run |crep| to send |ak| data to |ccloud| and use a common method, the `Metrics API <https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/monitoring/metrics-api.html>`__,  for collecting metrics for both.

Caution
~~~~~~~

.. include:: ../../examples/ccloud/docs/includes/ccloud-examples-caution.rst

|ccloud| Promo Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: ../../examples/ccloud/docs/includes/ccloud-examples-promo-code.rst

Setup |ccloud|
--------------

#. Create a |ccloud| account at https://confluent.cloud.

#. Install `Confluent Cloud CLI <https://docs.confluent.io/ccloud-cli/current/install.html>`__ v1.21.0 or later.

#. Using the CLI, log in to |ccloud| with the command ``ccloud login``, and use your |ccloud| username and password. The ``--save`` argument saves your |ccloud| user login credentials or refresh token (in the case of SSO) to the local ``netrc`` file.

   .. code:: shell

      ccloud login --save

#. Use the :ref:`ccloud-stack` for a quick, automated way to create resources in |ccloud|.  Executed with a single command, it uses the |ccloud| CLI to:

   -  Create a new environment.
   -  Create a new service account.
   -  Create a new Kafka cluster and associated credentials.
   -  Enable |sr-ccloud| and associated credentials.
   -  Create ACLs with wildcard for the service account.
   -  Generate a local configuration file with all above connection information.

   The first step is to get a bash library of useful functions for interacting with |ccloud| (one of which is ``cloud-stack``). This library is community-supported and is not supported by Confluent.

   .. code-block:: text

      curl -sS -o ccloud_library.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/confluentinc/examples/latest/utils/ccloud_library.sh

#. Using ``ccloud_library.sh`` which you downloaded in the previous step, create a new ``ccloud-stack`` (see :ref:`ccloud-stack` for advanced options). It creates real resources in |ccloud| and takes a few minutes to complete.

   .. code-block:: text

      source ./ccloud_library.sh
      ccloud::create_ccloud_stack
 
#. When ``ccloud-stack`` completes, view the local configuration file at ``stack-configs/java-service-account-<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID>.config`` that was auto-generated. It contains connection information for connecting to your newly created |ccloud| environment.

   .. code-block:: text

      cat stack-configs/java-service-account-*.config

#. In the current shell, set the environment variable ``SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID`` to the <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID> in the filename. For example, if the filename is called ``stack-configs/java-service-account-154143.config``, then set ``SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID=154143``.

   .. code-block:: text

      SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID=<fill in>

#. The |crep| :devx-cp-demo:`configuration file|scripts/connectors/submit_replicator_to_ccloud_config.sh` has parameters that specify how to connect to |ccloud|.  You could set these parameters manually, but to do this in an automated fashion, use another script to set env parameters customized for the |ccloud| instance created above. It reads your local |ccloud| configuration file, i.e., the auto-generated ``stack-configs/java-service-account-<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID>.config``, and creates files useful for |cp| components and clients connecting to |ccloud|.

   Get the script, which is also community-supported and not supported by Confluent.

   .. code-block:: text

      curl -sS -o ccloud-generate-cp-configs.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/confluentinc/examples/latest/ccloud/ccloud-generate-cp-configs.sh

#. Run the script against your auto-generated configuration file (the file created by ``ccloud-stack``).

   .. code-block:: text

      chmod 744 ./ccloud-generate-cp-configs.sh
      ./ccloud-generate-cp-configs.sh stack-configs/java-service-account-${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID}.config

#. The output of the script is a folder called ``delta_configs`` with sample configurations for all components and clients, which you can easily apply to any |ak| client or |cp| component. View the ``delta_configs/env.delta`` file.

   .. code-block:: text

      cat delta_configs/env.delta

#. Source the ``delta_configs/env.delta`` file into your environment. These environment variables will be used in a few sections when you run |crep| to copy data from your on-prem cluster to your |ccloud| cluster.

   .. code-block:: text

      source delta_configs/env.delta


Telemetry Reporter
------------------

#. Create a new ``Cloud`` API key and secret to authenticate with |ccloud|. These credentials will be used by the :ref:`telemetry_reporter` and used by the Metrics API, which can be used for hosted on-prem clusters as well as |ccloud| clusters.

   .. code:: shell

      ccloud api-key create --resource cloud -o json

#. Verify your output resembles:

   .. code-block:: text

      }

   The value of the API key, in this case ``QX7X4VA4DFJTTOIA``, and API secret,
   in this case ``fjcDDyr0Nm84zZr77ku/AQqCKQOOmb35Ql68HQnb60VuU+xLKiu/n2UNQ0WYXp/D``,
   will differ in your output.

#. Set parameters to reference these credentials returned in the previous step.

   .. code-block:: text

      METRICS_API_KEY='QX7X4VA4DFJTTOIA'
      METRICS_API_SECRET='fjcDDyr0Nm84zZr77ku/AQqCKQOOmb35Ql68HQnb60VuU+xLKiu/n2UNQ0WYXp/D'

#. :ref:`Dynamically configure <kafka-dynamic-configurations>` the ``cp-demo`` cluster to use the Telemetry Reporter, which sends metrics to |ccloud|. This requires setting 3 configuration parameters: ``confluent.telemetry.enabled=true``, ``confluent.telemetry.api.key``, and ``confluent.telemetry.api.secret``.

   .. code-block:: text

      docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-configs \
        --bootstrap-server kafka1:12091 \
        --alter \
        --entity-type brokers \

        --add-config confluent.telemetry.enabled=true,confluent.telemetry.api.key=${METRICS_API_KEY},confluent.telemetry.api.secret=${METRICS_API_SECRET}

#. Check the broker logs to verify the brokers were dynamically configured.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      docker-compose logs kafka1 | grep confluent.telemetry.api.key

   Your output should resemble the following, but the ``confluent.telemetry.api.key`` value will be different in your environment.

   .. code-block:: text

      kafka1            | 	confluent.telemetry.api.key = QX7X4VA4DFJTTOIA
      kafka1            | 	confluent.telemetry.api.secret = [hidden]


|crep|
------

#. If you have been running ``cp-demo`` for a long time, you may need to refresh your local token to log back into MDS:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      ./scripts/helper/refresh_mds_login.sh

#. Set the |crep| name.

   .. code-block:: text

      REPLICATOR_NAME=replicate-topic-to-ccloud

#. Create a role binding to permit a new instance of |crep| to be submitted to the local connect cluster with id ``connect-cluster``.

   Get the |ak| cluster ID:

   .. literalinclude:: includes/get_kafka_cluster_id_from_host.sh

   Create the role bindings:

   .. code-block:: text

      docker-compose exec tools bash -c "confluent iam rolebinding create \
          --principal User:connectorSubmitter \
          --role ResourceOwner \
          --resource Connector:$REPLICATOR_NAME \
          --kafka-cluster-id ${KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID} \
          --connect-cluster-id connect-cluster"

#. View the |crep| :devx-cp-demo:`configuration file|scripts/connectors/submit_replicator_to_ccloud_config.sh`. It is configured to copy from the |ak| topic ``wikipedia.parsed`` (on-prem) to the cloud topic ``wikipedia.parsed.ccloud.replica`` in |ccloud|. Note that it uses the local connect cluster (the origin site), so the |crep| configuration has overrides for the producer. The configuration parameters that use variables are read from the env variables that you sourced in an earlier step.

#. Submit the |crep| connector to the local connect cluster.

   .. code-block:: text

      ./scripts/connectors/submit_replicator_to_ccloud_config.sh

#. It takes about 1 minute to show up in the Connectors view in |c3|.  When it does, verify |crep| to |ccloud| has started properly, and there are now 4 connectors:

   .. figure:: images/connectors-with-rep-to-ccloud.png

#. Log into `Confluent Cloud <https://confluent.cloud>`__ UI and verify you see the topic ``wikipedia.parsed.ccloud.replica`` and its messages.

#. View the schema for this topic that is already registered in |ccloud| |sr|. In ``cp-demo``, in the :devx-cp-demo:`Replicator configuration file|scripts/connectors/submit_replicator_to_ccloud_config.sh`, ``value.converter`` is configured to use ``io.confluent.connect.avro.AvroConverter``, therefore it automatically registers new schemas, as needed, while copying data. The schema ID in the on-prem |sr| will not match the schema ID in the |ccloud| |sr|. (See documentation for other :ref:`schema migration options <schemaregistry_migrate>`)

.. _cp-demo-monitoring:

==========
Monitoring
==========

This tutorial has demonstrated how |c3| helps users manage their |cp| deployment and how it provides monitoring capabilities for the cluster and applications.
For a practical guide to optimizing your |ak| deployment for various service goals including throughput, latency, durability and availability, and useful metrics to monitor for performance and cluster health for on-prem |ak| clusters, see the `Optimizing Your Apache Kafka Deployment <https://www.confluent.io/white-paper/optimizing-your-apache-kafka-deployment/>`__ whitepaper.

For most |cp| users the |c3| monitoring and integrations are sufficient for production usage in their on-prem |ak-tm| deployments.
There are additional monitoring solutions for various use cases, as described below.

Metrics API
-----------

.. include:: includes/metrics-api-intro.rst

See :ref:`cp-demo-hybrid` for more information.

JMX
---

Some users wish to integrate with other monitoring solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, and Splunk.
The following JMX-based monitoring stacks help users setup a 'single pane of glass' monitoring solution for all their organization's services and applications, including |ak|.

Here are some examples of monitoring stacks that integrate with |cp|:

#. `JMX Exporter + Prometheus + Grafana <https://github.com/confluentinc/jmx-monitoring-stacks>`__ (runnable with cp-demo from https://github.com/confluentinc/jmx-monitoring-stacks):

.. _cp-demo-teardown:
      
========
Teardown
========

#. Stop the consumer group ``app`` to stop consuming from topic
   ``wikipedia.parsed``. Note that the command below stops the consumers
   gracefully with ``kill -15``, so the consumers follow the shutdown
   sequence.

   .. code:: bash

         ./scripts/app/stop_consumer_app_group_graceful.sh

#. Stop the Docker environment, destroy all components and clear all Docker
   volumes.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          ./scripts/stop.sh

#. If you ran |crep| to copy data from this local on-prem |ak| cluster to |ccloud|, then follow the clean up procedure in :ref:`cp-demo-ccloud-cleanup` to avoid unexpected |ccloud| charges.


.. _cp-demo-troubleshooting:

===============
Troubleshooting
===============

If the start script does not complete successfully, please go through the following troubleshooting steps.

Docker
------

#. Verify that the status of all the Docker containers show ``Up`` state.

   .. code-block:: bash

      docker-compose ps

#. In the advanced Docker preferences settings, verify the following resources are allocated to Docker:

   - Memory: at least 8 GB (default is 2 GB)
   - CPU cores: at least 2 cores

#. Verify you have not run out of disk storage needed for Docker's "disk image" file (`Docker documentation <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/space/>`__).

Logs
----

#. If the script errors out before completing, or if there are Docker containers that are not in ``Up`` state, view the container's logs with the command ``docker-compose logs [container]`` and look for error messages and exceptions.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      docker-compose logs

#. If there are any errors that indicate issues with TLS communication, verify that the TLS certificates were properly generated and that there are no errors in the following files:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ls scripts/security/*.log

Security
--------

#. If there are any errors that indicate issues with TLS communication, force TLS certificates to be regenerated by starting the script with ``CLEAN=true``:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      CLEAN=true ./scripts/start.sh

#. If a command that communicates with |zk| appears to be failing with the error ``org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException$NoAuthException``,
   change the container you are running the command from to be either ``kafka1`` or ``kafka2``.  This is because |zk| is configured for
   :ref:`SASL/DIGEST-MD5 <sasl_plain_zk>`, and
   any commands that communicate with |zk| need properties set for |zk| authentication.

Validate
--------

#. Verify there are messages in the |ak|  topics, including ``wikipedia.parsed``:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      ./scripts/consumers/listen.sh

#. Run the :devx-cp-demo:`validation scripts|scripts/validate/` to verify that they pass.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      cd scripts/validate/

CLI Login
---------

#. If you are running ``cp-demo`` for a long time and issuing Confluent CLI commands on the ``tools`` container that error out with:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          Your token has expired. You are now logged out.
          Error: You must log in to run that command.

   Then run the following command, which refreshes the token by logging back in to MDS:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          ./scripts/helper/refresh_mds_login.sh
