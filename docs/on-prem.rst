Module 1: Deploy |cp| Demo Environment Using Script
===================================================

.. _cp-demo-run:

============================
Run on-premises |cp| cluster
============================

``cp-demo`` is a Docker environment and has all services running on one host.
It is meant exclusively to easily demo |CP|, but in production, do not deploy all |cp| services on a single host.

Also, in production, |c3| should be deployed with a valid license in
:ref:`management mode <mode_settings>` in conjunction with
:ref:`Confluent Health+ <health-plus>` for monitoring.

If you prefer non-Docker examples, please go to `confluentinc/examples GitHub repository <https://github.com/confluentinc/examples>`__.

After you run through the guided tutorial below, apply the concepts you learn here to build your own event streaming pipeline in |ccloud|, a fully managed, cloud-native event streaming platform powered by |ak|. When you sign up for `Confluent Cloud <https://confluent.cloud>`__, use the promo code ``CPDEMO50`` to receive an additional $50 free usage (`details <https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud-promo-disclaimer>`__).


.. _cp-demo-prereqs:

Prerequisites
-------------

This example has been validated with:

-  Docker engine version 20.10.12
-  Docker Compose version 2.4.1
-  Java version 11.0.8
-  Ubuntu 18.04
-  OpenSSL 1.1.1
-  git
-  curl
-  jq

Setup
-----

You can run this demo locally with Docker or in a cloud IDE with :gitpod_link:`Gitpod|`.

Docker
~~~~~~

This demo has been validated with Docker as described in :ref:`cp-demo-prereqs`.
If you are using Docker:

#. In Docker's advanced `settings <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#advanced>`__, increase the memory dedicated to Docker to at least 8 GB (default is 2 GB) and ensure Docker is allocated at least 2 CPU cores.

#. Clone the `confluentinc/cp-demo GitHub repository <https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-demo>`__:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

       git clone https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-demo

#. Navigate to the ``cp-demo`` directory and switch to the |cp| release branch:

   .. codewithvars:: bash

      cd cp-demo
      git checkout |release_post_branch|

Gitpod
~~~~~~

This demo is enabled to run with Gitpod, but support for the Gitpod workflow is best effort from the `community <https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-demo/issues>`__.
If you are using :gitpod_link:`Gitpod|`, the demo will automatically start after the Gitpod workspace is ready. ``VIZ=false`` is used to save system resources.

Login into |c3| (port ``9021``) by clicking on ``Open Browser`` option in the pop-up:

.. figure:: images/gitpod_port_popup.png

or by selecting ``Remote Explorer`` on the left sidebar and then clicking on the ``Open Browser`` option corresponding to the port you want to connect to:

.. figure:: images/gitpod_port_explorer.png


Start
-----

Within the ``cp-demo`` directory, there is a single :devx-cp-demo:`script|scripts/start.sh` that runs the ``cp-demo`` workflow end-to-end.
It generates the keys and certificates, brings up the Docker containers, and configures and validates the environment.
You can run it with optional settings:

- ``CLEAN``: controls whether certificates are regenerated
- ``C3_KSQLDB_HTTPS``: controls whether |c3| and ksqlDB server use ``HTTP`` or ``HTTPS`` (default: ``false`` for ``HTTP``). This option is not supported with :gitpod_link:`Gitpod|`.
- ``VIZ``: enables Elasticsearch and Kibana (default: ``true``)

#. To run ``cp-demo`` the first time with defaults, run the following command. The very first run downloads all the required Docker images (~15 minutes) and sets up the environment (~5 minutes).

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      ./scripts/start.sh

#. On subsequent runs, if you have not deleted the generated certificates and the locally built |kconnect| image, they will be reused. To force them to be rebuilt, you can set ``CLEAN=true``.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      CLEAN=true ./scripts/start.sh

#. ``cp-demo`` supports access to the |c3| GUI via either ``http://`` (the default) or secure ``https://``, the latter employing a self-signed CA and certificates generated during deployment. In order to run ksqlDB queries from |c3| later in this tutorial, both ksqlDB and |c3| must be running in either ``http`` or ``https`` `mode <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/ksqldb/integrate-ksql-with-confluent-control-center.html#configuration-settings-for-ksqldb-and-c3-short>`__. To run ``cp-demo`` in ``https`` mode, set ``C3_KSQLDB_HTTPS=true`` when starting ``cp-demo``:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      C3_KSQLDB_HTTPS=true ./scripts/start.sh

#. Elasticsearch and Kibana increase localhost memory requirements for ``cp-demo``. For users who want to run ``cp-demo`` with a smaller memory footprint, opt-out of these components by setting ``VIZ=false`` when starting ``cp-demo``.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      VIZ=false ./scripts/start.sh

#. After the start script completes, run through the pre-flight checks below and follow the guided tutorial through this on-premises deployment.


Pre-flight Checks
-----------------

Before going through the tutorial, check that the environment has started correctly.
If any of these pre-flight checks fails, consult the :ref:`cp-demo-troubleshooting` section.

#. Verify the status of the Docker containers show ``Up`` state.

   .. code-block:: bash

        docker-compose ps

   Your output should resemble:

   .. code-block:: text

Log into |c3| 
-------------

#. If you ran ``cp-demo`` with ``C3_KSQLDB_HTTPS=false`` (which is the default), log into the |c3| GUI from a web browser at the following URL:

   .. code-block:: text

      http://localhost:9021

#. If you ran ``cp-demo`` with ``C3_KSQLDB_HTTPS=true`` (not supported with :gitpod_link:`Gitpod|`), log into the |c3| GUI from a web browser at the following URL:

   .. code-block:: text

      https://localhost:9022

   The browser will detect a self-signed, untrusted certificate and certificate authority, and issue a privacy warning as shown below. To proceed, accept this certificate using your browser's process for this, which will then last for the duration of that browser session.

   - **Chrome**: click on ``Advanced`` and when the window expands, click on ``Proceed to localhost (unsafe)``.

     .. figure:: images/c3-chrome-cert-warning.png
        :width: 500px

   - **Safari**: open a new private browsing window (``Shift + âŒ˜ + N``), click on ``Show Details`` and when the window expands, click on ``visit this website``.

     .. figure:: images/c3-safari-cert-warning.png
        :width: 500px

#. At the login screen, log into |c3| as ``superUser`` and password ``superUser``, which has super user access to the cluster. You may also log in as :devx-cp-demo:`other users|scripts/security/ldap_users` to learn how each user's view changes depending on their permissions.

   .. figure:: images/broker_metrics.png




Topics
------

#. |c3| can manage topics in a Kafka cluster. Click on "Topics".

#. Scroll down and click on the topic ``wikipedia.parsed``.

   .. figure:: images/topic_list_wikipedia.png
         :alt: image

#. View an overview of this topic:

   - Throughput

         :alt: image

|kconnect-long|
---------------

This example runs two connectors:

- SSE source connector
- Elasticsearch sink connector

They are running on a |kconnect| worker that is configured with |cp| security features.
The |kconnect| worker's embedded producer is configured to be idempotent, exactly-once in order semantics per partition (in the event of an error that causes a producer retry, the same messageâ€”which is still sent by the producer multiple timesâ€”will only be written to the Kafka log on the broker once).

#. The |kconnect-long| Docker container is running a custom image which has a specific set of connectors and transformations needed by ``cp-demo``. See :devx-cp-demo:`this Dockerfile|Dockerfile` for more details.

#. |c3| uses the |kconnect-long| API to manage multiple :ref:`connect clusters <kafka_connect>`.  Click on "Connect".

#. Select ``connect1``, the name of the cluster of |kconnect| workers.

   .. figure:: images/connect_default.png

#. Verify the connectors running in this example:

   - source connector ``wikipedia-sse``: view the example's SSE source connector :devx-cp-demo:`configuration file|scripts/connectors/submit_wikipedia_sse_config.sh`.
   - sink connector ``elasticsearch-ksqldb`` consuming from the Kafka topic ``WIKIPEDIABOT``: view the example's Elasticsearch sink connector :devx-cp-demo:`configuration file|scripts/connectors/submit_elastic_sink_config.sh`.

   .. figure:: images/connector_list.png

#. Click any connector name to view or modify any details of the connector configuration and custom transforms.


.. _ksql-demo-3:

ksqlDB
------

In this example, ksqlDB is authenticated and authorized to connect to the secured Kafka cluster, and it is already running queries as defined in the :devx-cp-demo:`ksqlDB command file|scripts/ksqlDB/statements.sql`.
Its embedded producer is configured to be idempotent, exactly-once in order semantics per partition (in the event of an error that causes a producer retry, the same messageâ€”which is still sent by the producer multiple timesâ€”will only be written to the Kafka log on the broker once).

#. In the navigation bar, click **ksqlDB**.

#. From the list of ksqlDB applications, select ``wikipedia``.

   .. figure:: images/ksql_link.png
      :alt: image

#. View the ksqlDB Flow to see the streams and tables created in the example, and how they relate to one another.

   .. figure:: images/ksqldb_flow.png
      :alt: image

#. Use |c3| to interact with ksqlDB, or run ksqlDB CLI to get to the ksqlDB CLI prompt.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

        docker-compose exec ksqldb-cli bash -c 'ksql -u ksqlDBUser -p ksqlDBUser http://ksqldb-server:8088'

#. View the existing ksqlDB streams. (If you are using the ksqlDB CLI, at the ``ksql>`` prompt type ``SHOW STREAMS;``)

   .. figure:: images/ksql_streams_list.png
      :alt: image

#. Click on ``WIKIPEDIA`` to describe the schema (fields or columns) of an existing ksqlDB stream. (If you are using the ksqlDB CLI, at the ``ksql>`` prompt type ``DESCRIBE WIKIPEDIA;``)

   .. figure:: images/wikipedia_describe.png
      :width: 600px
      :alt: image

#. View the existing ksqlDB tables. (If you are using the ksqlDB CLI, at the ``ksql>`` prompt type ``SHOW TABLES;``). One table is called ``WIKIPEDIA_COUNT_GT_1``, which counts occurrences within a `tumbling window <https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/concepts/time-and-windows-in-ksqldb-queries/#tumbling-window>`__.

   .. figure:: images/ksql_tables_list.png
      :alt: image

#. View the existing ksqlDB queries, which are continuously running. (If you are using the ksqlDB CLI, at the ``ksql>`` prompt type ``SHOW QUERIES;``).

   .. figure:: images/ksql_queries_list.png
      :alt: image

#. View messages from different ksqlDB streams and tables. Click on your stream of choice and then click **Query stream** to open the Query Editor. The editor shows a pre-populated query, like ``select * from WIKIPEDIA EMIT CHANGES;``, and it shows results for newly arriving data.

   .. figure:: images/ksql_query_topic.png
      :width: 600px

#. Click **ksqlDB Editor** and run the ``SHOW PROPERTIES;`` statement. You can see the configured ksqlDB server properties and check these values with the :devx-cp-demo:`docker-compose.yml|docker-compose.yml` file.

   .. figure:: images/ksql_properties.png
      :alt: image

#. The `ksqlDB processing log <https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/reference/processing-log/>`__ captures per-record errors during processing to help developers debug their ksqlDB queries. In this example, the processing log uses mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication, as configured in the custom :devx-cp-demo:`log4j properties file|scripts/helper/log4j-secure.properties`, to write entries into a Kafka topic. To see it in action, in the ksqlDB editor run the following "bad" query for 20 seconds:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      SELECT 1/0 FROM wikipedia EMIT CHANGES;

   No records should be returned from this query. ksqlDB writes errors into the processing log for each record. View the processing log topic ``ksql-clusterksql_processing_log`` with topic inspection (jump to offset 0/partition 0) or the corresponding ksqlDB stream ``KSQL_PROCESSING_LOG`` with the ksqlDB editor (set ``auto.offset.reset=earliest``).

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      SELECT * FROM KSQL_PROCESSING_LOG EMIT CHANGES;


Consumers
---------

#. |c3| enables you to monitor consumer lag and throughput performance. Consumer lag is the topic's high water mark (latest offset for the topic that has been written) minus the current consumer offset (latest offset read for that topic by that consumer group). Keep in mind the topic's write rate and consumer group's read rate when you consider the significance the consumer lag's size. Click on "Consumers".

#. Consumer lag is available on a `per-consumer basis <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/control-center/consumers.html#view-consumer-lag-details-for-a-consumer-group>`__, including the embedded Connect consumers for sink connectors (e.g., ``connect-elasticsearch-ksqldb``), ksqlDB queries (e.g., consumer groups whose names start with ``_confluent-ksql-ksql-clusterquery_``), console consumers (e.g., ``WIKIPEDIANOBOT-consumer``), etc.  Consumer lag is also available on a `per-topic basis <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/control-center/topics/view.html#view-consumer-lag-for-a-topic>`__.

   .. figure:: images/consumer_group_list.png
      :alt: image

#. View consumer lag for the persistent ksqlDB "Create Stream As Select" query ``CSAS_WIKIPEDIABOT``, which is displayed as ``_confluent-ksql-ksql-clusterquery_CSAS_WIKIPEDIABOT_5`` in the consumer group list.

   .. figure:: images/ksql_query_CSAS_WIKIPEDIABOT_consumer_lag.png
      :alt: image

#. View consumer lag for the |kstreams| application under the consumer group id ``wikipedia-activity-monitor``. This application is run by the `cnfldemos/cp-demo-kstreams <https://hub.docker.com/r/cnfldemos/cp-demo-kstreams>`__ Docker container (application :devx-cp-demo:`source code|kstreams-app/src/main/java/io/confluent/demos/common/wiki/WikipediaActivityMonitor.java`). The |kstreams| application is configured to connect to the |ak| cluster with the following :devx-cp-demo:`client configuration|env_files/streams-demo.env` file.

   .. figure:: images/activity-monitor-consumer.png
      :alt: image

#. Consumption metrics are available on a `per-consumer basis <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/control-center/consumers.html#view-consumption-details-for-a-consumer-group>`__. These consumption charts are only populated if `Confluent Monitoring Interceptors <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/control-center/installation/clients.html>`__ are configured, as they are in this example. You can view ``% messages consumed`` and ``end-to-end latency``.  View consumption metrics for the persistent ksqlDB "Create Stream As Select" query ``CSAS_WIKIPEDIABOT``, which is displayed as ``_confluent-ksql-ksql-clusterquery_CSAS_WIKIPEDIABOT_5`` in the consumer group list.

   .. figure:: images/ksql_query_CSAS_WIKIPEDIABOT_consumption.png
      :alt: image

#. |c3| shows which consumers in a consumer group are consuming from which partitions and on which brokers those partitions reside.  |c3| updates as consumer rebalances occur in a consumer group.  Start consuming from topic ``wikipedia.parsed`` with a new consumer group ``app`` with one consumer ``consumer_app_1``. It runs in the background.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          ./scripts/app/start_consumer_app.sh 1

#. Let this consumer group run for 2 minutes until |c3|
   shows the consumer group ``app`` with steady consumption.
   This consumer group ``app`` has a single consumer ``consumer_app_1`` consuming all of the partitions in the topic ``wikipedia.parsed``. 

   .. figure:: images/consumer_start_one.png
      :alt: image

#. Add a second consumer ``consumer_app_2`` to the existing consumer
   group ``app``.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          ./scripts/app/start_consumer_app.sh 2

#. Let this consumer group run for 2 minutes until |c3|
   shows the consumer group ``app`` with steady consumption.
   Notice that the consumers ``consumer_app_1`` and ``consumer_app_2``
   now share consumption of the partitions in the topic
   ``wikipedia.parsed``.

Security
--------

Overview
~~~~~~~~


All components and clients in ``cp-demo`` make full use of |cp|'s extensive :ref:`security features <security>`.

-  :ref:`Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) <rbac-overview>` for authorization. Give principals access to resources using role-bindings.

   .. note:: RBAC is powered by the :ref:`Metadata Service (MDS) <rbac-mds-config>` which uses |csa| to connect to an OpenLDAP directory service. This enables group-based authorization for scalable access management.

-  :ref:`SSL <kafka_ssl_authentication>` for encryption and mTLS for authentication. The example :devx-cp-demo:`automatically generates|scripts/security/certs-create.sh` SSL certificates and creates keystores, truststores, and secures them with a password. 
-  |zk| is configured with :ref:`mTLS <zk-mtls>` and :ref:`SASL/DIGEST-MD5 <zk-auth-sasl>` authentication.
-  :ref:`HTTPS for Control Center <https_settings>`.
-  :ref:`HTTPS for Schema Registry <schemaregistry_security>`.
-  :ref:`HTTPS for Connect <connect_security>`.

You can see each component's security configuration in the example's :devx-cp-demo:`docker-compose.yml|docker-compose.yml` file.

.. note::
    This example showcases a secure |CP| for educational purposes and is not meant to be complete best practices. There are certain differences between what is shown in the example and what you should do in production:

    * Authorize users only for operations that they need, instead of making all of them super users
    * If the ``PLAINTEXT`` security protocol is used, these ``ANONYMOUS`` usernames should not be configured as super users
    * Consider not even opening the ``PLAINTEXT`` port if ``SSL`` or ``SASL_SSL`` are configured


|zk| has two listener ports:

+---------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------+
| Name          | Protocol       | In this example, used for ...                                      | ZooKeeper       |
+===============+================+====================================================================+=================+
| N/A           | SASL/DIGEST-MD5| Validating trial license for |crest| and |sr|. (no TLS support)    | 2181            |
+---------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------+
| N/A           | mTLS           | Broker communication (kafka1, kafka2)                              | 2182            |
+---------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------+



Each broker has five listener ports:

End clients (non-CP clients):

- Authenticate using mTLS via the broker SSL listener.
- If they are also using |sr|, authenticate to |sr| via LDAP.
- If they are also using Confluent Monitoring interceptors, authenticate using mTLS via the broker SSL listener.
-   Should never use the TOKEN listener which is meant only for internal communication between Confluent components.

  - If you wish to authenticate clients with username and password via LDAP, you would create a new SASL PLAIN client listener with Confluent's `LdapAuthenticateCallbackHandler <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/authentication_sasl/client-authentication-ldap.html>`__. This is omitted from the demo for simplicity.

- See :devx-cp-demo:`client configuration|env_files/streams-demo.env/` used in the example by the ``streams-demo`` container running the |kstreams| application ``wikipedia-activity-monitor``.

Broker Listeners
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Verify the ports on which the Kafka brokers are listening with the
   following command, and they should match the table shown below:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

          docker-compose logs kafka1 | grep "Registered broker 1"
          docker-compose logs kafka2 | grep "Registered broker 2"

#. For example only: Communicate with brokers via the PLAINTEXT port, client security configurations are not required

   .. sourcecode:: bash

           # CLEAR/PLAINTEXT port
           docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-consumer-groups \
              --list \
              --bootstrap-server kafka1:12091

#. End clients: Communicate with brokers via the SSL port, and SSL parameters configured via the ``--command-config`` argument for command line tools or ``--consumer.config`` for kafka-console-consumer.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

           # SSL/SSL port
           docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-consumer-groups \
              --list \
              --bootstrap-server kafka1:11091 \
              --command-config /etc/kafka/secrets/client_without_interceptors_ssl.config

#. If a client tries to communicate with brokers via the SSL port but does not specify the SSL parameters, it fails

   .. sourcecode:: bash

           # SSL/SSL port
           docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-consumer-groups \
              --list \
              --bootstrap-server kafka1:11091

   Your output should resemble:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

           ERROR Uncaught exception in thread 'kafka-admin-client-thread | adminclient-1': (org.apache.kafka.common.utils.KafkaThread)
           java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
           ...

#. Communicate with brokers via the SASL_PLAINTEXT port, and SASL_PLAINTEXT parameters configured via the ``--command-config`` argument for command line tools or ``--consumer.config`` for kafka-console-consumer.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

           # INTERNAL/SASL_PLAIN port
           docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-consumer-groups \
              --list \
              --bootstrap-server kafka1:9091 \
              --command-config /etc/kafka/secrets/client_sasl_plain.config

Authorization with RBAC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Verify which users are configured to be super users.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

         docker-compose logs kafka1 | grep "super.users ="

   Your output should resemble the following. Notice this authorizes each service name which authenticates as itself,
   as well as the unauthenticated ``PLAINTEXT`` which authenticates as ``ANONYMOUS`` (for demo purposes only):

   .. sourcecode:: bash

         kafka1            | 	super.users = User:admin;User:mds;User:superUser;User:ANONYMOUS

#. From the |c3| UI, in the Administration menu, click the *Manage role assignments* option. Click on ``Assignments`` and then the Kafka cluster ID. From the ``Topic`` list, verify that the LDAP user ``appSA`` is allowed to access a few topics, including any topic whose name starts with ``wikipedia``. This role assignment was done during ``cp-demo`` startup in the :devx-cp-demo:`create-role-bindings.sh script|scripts/helper/create-role-bindings.sh`.

   .. figure:: images/appSA_topic_assignments.png

#. Verify that LDAP user ``appSA`` (which is not a super user) can consume messages from topic ``wikipedia.parsed``.  Notice that it is configured to authenticate to brokers with mTLS and authenticate to |sr| with LDAP.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

         docker-compose exec connect kafka-avro-console-consumer \
           --bootstrap-server kafka1:11091,kafka2:11092 \
           --consumer-property security.protocol=SSL \

           --group wikipedia.test \
           --topic wikipedia.parsed \
           --max-messages 5

#. Verify that LDAP user ``badapp`` cannot consume messages from topic ``wikipedia.parsed``.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

         docker-compose exec connect kafka-avro-console-consumer \
           --bootstrap-server kafka1:11091,kafka2:11092 \

           --consumer-property ssl.truststore.password=confluent \
           --consumer-property ssl.keystore.location=/etc/kafka/secrets/kafka.badapp.keystore.jks \
           --consumer-property ssl.keystore.password=confluent \

           --group wikipedia.test \
           --topic wikipedia.parsed \
           --max-messages 5

   Your output should resemble:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

#. Because |zk| is configured for :ref:`SASL/DIGEST-MD5 <kafka_sasl_auth_plain>`, any commands that communicate with |zk| need properties set for |zk| authentication. This authentication configuration is provided by the ``KAFKA_OPTS`` setting on the brokers. For example, notice that the :devx-cp-demo:`consumer throttle script|scripts/app/throttle_consumer.sh` runs on the Docker container ``kafka1`` which has the appropriate `KAFKA_OPTS` setting. The command would otherwise fail if run on any other container aside from ``kafka1`` or ``kafka2``.

#. Next step: Learn more about security with the :ref:`Security Tutorial <security_tutorial>`.


Data Governance with |sr|
-------------------------

All the applications and connectors used in this example are configured to automatically read and write Avro-formatted data, leveraging the :ref:`Confluent Schema Registry <schemaregistry_intro>`.

The security in place between |sr| and the end clients, e.g. ``appSA``, is as follows:

- Encryption: TLS, e.g. client has ``schema.registry.ssl.truststore.*`` configurations
- Authentication: bearer token authentication from HTTP basic auth headers, e.g. client has ``basic.auth.user.info`` and ``basic.auth.credentials.source`` configurations
- Authorization: |sr| uses the bearer token with RBAC to authorize the client


#. View the |sr| subjects for topics that have registered schemas for their keys and/or values. Notice the ``curl`` arguments include (a) TLS information required to interact with |sr| which is listening for HTTPS on port 8085, and (b) authentication credentials required for RBAC (using `superUser:superUser` to see all of them).

   .. code-block:: text

       docker exec schemaregistry curl -s -X GET \
          --tlsv1.2 \

          -u superUser:superUser \
          https://schemaregistry:8085/subjects | jq .

   Your output should resemble:

     {"id":9}

#. View the new schema for the subject ``users-value``. From |c3|, click **Topics**. Scroll down to and click on the topic `users` and select "SCHEMA".

   .. figure:: images/schema1.png

   You may alternatively request the schema via the command line:

   .. code-block:: text

       docker exec schemaregistry curl -s -X GET \
          --tlsv1.2 \
          --cacert /etc/kafka/secrets/snakeoil-ca-1.crt \
          -u appSA:appSA \

       "id": 9,
       "schema": "{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"user\",\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"username\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"userid\",\"type\":\"long\"}]}"
     }

#. Describe the topic ``users``. Notice that it has a special configuration ``confluent.value.schema.validation=true`` which enables :ref:`Schema Validation <schema_validation>`,  a data governance feature in Confluent Server that gives operators a centralized location within the Kafka cluster itself to enforce data format correctness. Enabling |sv| allows brokers configured with ``confluent.schema.registry.url`` to validate that data produced to the topic is using a valid schema.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-topics \
         --describe \
         --topic users \
         --bootstrap-server kafka1:9091 \
         --command-config /etc/kafka/secrets/client_sasl_plain.config

	      Topic: users	Partition: 0	Leader: 1	Replicas: 1,2	Isr: 1,2	Offline: 
	      Topic: users	Partition: 1	Leader: 2	Replicas: 2,1	Isr: 2,1	Offline: 

#. Now produce a non-Avro message to this topic using ``kafka-console-producer``.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      docker-compose exec connect kafka-console-producer \
           --topic users \

           --producer-property ssl.keystore.password=confluent \
           --producer-property ssl.key.password=confluent

   After starting the console producer, it will wait for input. Enter a few characters and press enter.
   It should result in a failure with an error message that resembles:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      ERROR Error when sending message to topic users with key: null, value: 5 bytes with error: (org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.ErrorLoggingCallback)
      org.apache.kafka.common.InvalidRecordException: This record has failed the validation on broker and hence be rejected.

   Close the console producer by entering ``CTRL+C``.

#. Describe the topic ``wikipedia.parsed``, which is the topic that the `kafka-connect-sse` source connector is writing to. Notice that it also has enabled |sv|.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-topics \

#. Next step: Learn more about |sr| with the :ref:`Schema Registry Tutorial <schema_registry_tutorial>`.


|crest-long|
------------

The :ref:`Confluent REST Proxy <kafkarest_intro>`  is running for optional client access.
This demo showcases |crest-long| in two modes:

- Standalone service, listening for HTTPS requests on port 8086
- Embedded service on the |ak| brokers, listening for HTTPS requests on port 8091 on ``kafka1`` and on port 8092 on ``kafka2`` (these |crest| ports are shared with the broker's |mds-long| listener)

Standalone |crest|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the next few steps, use the |crest| that is running as a standalone service.

#. Use the standalone |crest| to try to produce a message to the topic ``users``, referencing schema id ``9``. This schema was registered in |sr| in the previous section. It should fail due to an authorization error.

Embedded |crest|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the next few steps, use the |crest| that is embedded on the |ak| brokers. Only :ref:`rest-proxy-v3` is supported this time.

#. Create a role binding for the client to be granted ``ResourceOwner`` role for the topic ``dev_users``.

   Get the |ak| cluster ID:

   .. literalinclude:: includes/get_kafka_cluster_id_from_host.sh

   Create the role binding:

   .. code-block:: text

      # Create the role binding for the topic ``dev_users``
      docker-compose exec tools bash -c "confluent iam rbac role-binding create \
          --principal User:appSA \
          --role ResourceOwner \
          --resource Topic:dev_users \
          --kafka-cluster-id $KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID"

#. Create the topic ``dev_users`` with embedded |crest|.

   Get the |ak| cluster ID:

   .. literalinclude:: includes/get_kafka_cluster_id_from_host.sh

   Use ``curl`` to create the topic:

   .. code-block:: text

      docker exec restproxy curl -s -X POST \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -H "accept: application/json" \
         -d "{\"topic_name\":\"dev_users\",\"partitions_count\":64,\"replication_factor\":2,\"configs\":[{\"name\":\"cleanup.policy\",\"value\":\"compact\"},{\"name\":\"compression.type\",\"value\":\"gzip\"}]}" \
         --cert /etc/kafka/secrets/mds.certificate.pem \
         --key /etc/kafka/secrets/mds.key \
         --tlsv1.2 \
         --cacert /etc/kafka/secrets/snakeoil-ca-1.crt \
         -u appSA:appSA \
         "https://kafka1:8091/kafka/v3/clusters/$KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID/topics" | jq

#. List topics with embedded |crest| to find the newly created ``dev_users``.

   Get the |ak| cluster ID:

   .. literalinclude:: includes/get_kafka_cluster_id_from_host.sh

   Use ``curl`` to list the topics:

   .. code-block:: text

      docker exec restproxy curl -s -X GET \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -H "accept: application/json" \

         --tlsv1.2 \
         --cacert /etc/kafka/secrets/snakeoil-ca-1.crt \
         -u appSA:appSA \
         https://kafka1:8091/kafka/v3/clusters/$KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID/topics | jq '.data[].topic_name'

   Your output should resemble below.  Output may vary, depending on other topics you may have created, but at least you should see the topic ``dev_users`` created in the previous step.

   .. code-block:: text

      "_confluent-monitoring"

Failed Broker
-------------

To simulate a failed broker, stop the Docker container running one of
the two Kafka brokers.

#. Stop the Docker container running Kafka broker 2.

   .. code-block:: bash

          docker-compose stop kafka2

#. After a few minutes, observe the Broker summary show that the number of brokers 
   has decreased from 2 to 1, and there are many under replicated
   partitions.

   .. figure:: images/broker_down_failed.png
      :alt: image

#. View Topic information details to see that there are out of sync replicas.

   .. figure:: images/broker_down_replicas.png
      :alt: image

#. Look at the production and consumption metrics and notice that the clients are all still working.

   .. figure:: images/broker_down_apps_working.png
      :alt: image

#. Restart the Docker container running Kafka broker 2.

   .. code-block:: bash

          docker-compose start kafka2

#. After about a minute, observe the Broker summary in |c3|.
   The broker count has recovered to 2, and the topic
   partitions are back to reporting no under replicated partitions.

   .. figure:: images/broker_down_steady.png
      :alt: image

#. Click on the broker count ``2`` inside the "Brokers" box and when
   the "Brokers overview" pane appears, click inside the "Partitioning
   and replication" box to view when broker counts changed.

   .. figure:: images/broker_down_times.png

Alerting
--------

There are many types of |c3-short|
:ref:`alerts <controlcenter_userguide_alerts>`
and many ways to configure them. Use the Alerts management page to
define triggers and actions, or click on individual resources
to setup alerts from there.

.. figure:: images/c3-alerts-bell-icon-initial.png
   :alt: image


#. This example already has pre-configured triggers and actions. View the
   Alerts ``Triggers`` screen, and click ``Edit`` against each trigger
   to see configuration details.

   -  The trigger ``Under Replicated Partitions`` happens when a broker
      reports non-zero under replicated partitions, and it causes an
      action ``Email Administrator``.
   -  The trigger ``Consumption Difference`` happens when consumption
      difference for the Elasticsearch connector consumer group is
      greater than ``0``, and it causes an action
      ``Email Administrator``.

   .. figure:: images/alerts_triggers.png
      :alt: image

#. If you followed the steps in the `failed broker <#failed-broker>`__
   section, view the Alert history to see that the trigger
   ``Under Replicated Partitions`` happened and caused an alert when you
   stopped broker 2.


   .. figure:: images/alerts_triggers_under_replication_partitions.png
      :alt: image


#. You can also trigger the ``Consumption Difference`` trigger. In the
   Kafka Connect -> Sinks screen, edit the running Elasticsearch sink
   connector.

#. In the Connect view, pause the Elasticsearch sink connector in Settings by
   pressing the pause icon in the top right. This stops consumption
   for the related consumer group.

   .. figure:: images/pause_connector.png
      :alt: image

#. View the Alert history to see that this trigger happened and caused
   an alert.

.. _cp-demo-monitoring:


|sbc-full|
----------

:ref:`Self-Balancing Clusters <sbc>` automates your resource workload balancing, provides failure detection and self-healing, and allows you to add or decommission brokers as needed, with no manual tuning required. This simplifies scale-up and scale-down operations, ensuring workload is assigned to new brokers and automating recovery in case of a failure.

This section showcases two features of |sbc-long|:

- Adding a new broker to the cluster (scale-up): observe |sbc-long| rebalance the cluster by assigning existing partitions to the new broker.
- Simulating a failure by killing a broker: observe |sbc-long| reassign the failed broker's replicas to the remaining brokers.

Before running this section:

- |sbc| requires 15 minutes to initialize and collect metrics from brokers in the cluster, so after starting ``cp-demo``, wait at least this time before proceeding.
- Because these steps add a third broker, ensure you have adequate resources allocated to Docker.

#. Run :devx-cp-demo:`scripts/sbc/add-broker.sh|scripts/sbc/add-broker.sh` to add a new broker ``kafka3`` to the cluster.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      ./scripts/sbc/add-broker.sh

   The script returns when |sbc-long| has acknowledged the broker addition and started a rebalance task.

#. Open |c3-short| at http://localhost:9021 and navigate to ``Brokers``.  The Self-balancing panel shows 1 in-progress task.

   .. figure:: images/sbc-add-broker-overview.png
      :alt: image

   Click on the panel and locate the in-progress add-broker task for broker with ID ``broker.3``.

   .. figure:: images/sbc-add-broker-task.png
      :alt: image

#. The add-broker rebalance task progresses through stages ``PLAN_COMPUTATION``, ``REASSIGNMENT`` and finally ``COMPLETED``.  The time spent in each phase varies depending on the hardware you are running.
   Check the status using the following scripts to read the broker logs:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      ./scripts/sbc/validate_sbc_add_broker_plan_computation.sh
      ./scripts/sbc/validate_sbc_add_broker_reassignment.sh
      ./scripts/sbc/validate_sbc_add_broker_completed.sh

#. After a few minutes, when rebalancing has completed, the add-broker rebalance task in |c3| moves to ``Success``.
   Run the following command to view replica placements for all topic-partitions in the cluster:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      docker-compose exec kafka1 kafka-replica-status \
          --bootstrap-server kafka1:9091 \
          --admin.config /etc/kafka/secrets/client_sasl_plain.config

   Look for instances of ``3`` in the ``Replica`` column, showing that rebalancing has assigned partition replicas (leaders and followers) to the new broker.

#. Simulate a broker-failure by running :devx-cp-demo:`scripts/sbc/kill-broker.sh|scripts/sbc/kill-broker.sh` to kill the previously-added broker ``kafka3``:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      ./scripts/sbc/kill-broker.sh

   This script returns when |sbc-long| has detected the broker failure and the recovery wait-time ``KAFKA_CONFLUENT_BALANCER_HEAL_BROKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD_MS`` has expired, triggering replica reassignment from the ``kafka3`` broker to the original two brokers.
   Note that in ``cp-demo``, the threshold time has been set to 30 seconds, which is artificially low but useful in a demo environment.

#. Monitor the progress of replica-reassignment from the failed broker, which eventually reduces the under-replicated partitions in the cluster back to zero.  To track completion of self-healing, check the ``Self-Balancing`` panel in |c3|, or run the following scripts:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      ./scripts/sbc/validate_sbc_kill_broker_started.sh
      ./scripts/sbc/validate_sbc_kill_broker_completed.sh

#. When self-healing has completed, the |ak| cluster should no longer have any under-replicated partitions that were previously assigned to failed broker ``kafka3``.
   Confirm this by running this command and verifying no output, meaning no out-of-sync replicas:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      docker exec kafka1 kafka-replica-status \
           --bootstrap-server kafka1:9091 \
           --admin.config /etc/kafka/secrets/client_sasl_plain.config \
           --verbose | grep "IsInIsr: false"

==========
Monitoring
==========

This tutorial has demonstrated how |c3| helps users manage their |cp| deployment and how it provides monitoring capabilities for the cluster and applications.
For a practical guide to optimizing your |ak| deployment for various service goals including throughput, latency, durability and availability, and useful metrics to monitor for performance and cluster health for on-premises |ak| clusters, see the `Optimizing Your Apache Kafka Deployment <https://www.confluent.io/white-paper/optimizing-your-apache-kafka-deployment/>`__ whitepaper.

For most |cp| users the |c3| monitoring and integrations are sufficient for production usage in their on-premises |ak-tm| deployments.
There are additional monitoring solutions for various use cases, as described below.

Metrics API
-----------

.. include:: includes/metrics-api-intro.rst

See :ref:`cp-demo-hybrid` to play hands-on with the Metrics API.

JMX
---

Some users wish to integrate with other monitoring solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, and Splunk.
The following JMX-based monitoring stacks help users setup a 'single pane of glass' monitoring solution for all their organization's services and applications, including |ak|.

Here are some examples of monitoring stacks that integrate with |cp|:
