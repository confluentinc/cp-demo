# `BRANCH` is the global setting for build branches of Confluent packages

# IMPORTANT:  This setting affects only those CP projects whose documentation will be
#             pulled in via git-cloning their repositories such as schema-registry.
#             In contrast, the CP documentation for Kafka is NOT affected by this setting.
#
# Be aware that projects may have different naming conventions for branches.
# If needed, make use of project-specific overrides as described below.
#
# Examples
# --------
# BRANCH="origin/master" # for snapshots
# BRANCH="origin/3.2.x" # for development/maintenance branches
# BRANCH="v3.2.0" # tag
#
# Internal note: We MUST `export` these variables so that the shell environment
# can automatically pass them as environment variables to the Makefile.
#
# IMPORTANT: For *branches*, this must be a remote ref, i.e. "orgin/foobar", not just "foobar"!
