# Kafka Event Streaming Applications

This example and accompanying tutorial show users how to deploy an Apache KafkaÂ® event streaming application using [ksqlDB](https://www.confluent.io/product/ksql/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=demo&utm_campaign=ch.cp-demo_type.community_content.cp-demo) and [Kafka Streams](https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/index.html?utm_source=github&utm_medium=demo&utm_campaign=ch.cp-demo_type.community_content.cp-demo) for stream processing. All the components in the Confluent platform have security enabled end-to-end. Run the example with the [tutorial](https://docs.confluent.io/current/tutorials/cp-demo/docs/index.html?utm_source=github&utm_medium=demo&utm_campaign=ch.cp-demo_type.community_content.cp-demo).

## Overview

The use case is a Kafka event streaming application for real-time edits to real Wikipedia pages.
Wikimedia Foundation has IRC channels that publish edits happening to real wiki pages (e.g. `#en.wikipedia`, `#en.wiktionary`) in real time.
Using Kafka Connect, a Kafka source connector `kafka-connect-irc` streams raw messages from these IRC channels, and a custom Kafka Connect transform `kafka-connect-transform-wikiedit` transforms these messages and then the messages are written to a Kafka cluster.
This example uses ksqlDB and a Kafka Streams application for data processing.
Then a Kafka sink connector `kafka-connect-elasticsearch`streams the data out of Kafka, and the data is materialized into Elasticsearch for analysis by Kibana.
Confluent Replicator  is also copying messages from a topic to another topic in the same cluster.
All data is using Confluent Schema Registry and Avro.
Confluent Control Center is managing and monitoring the deployment.
